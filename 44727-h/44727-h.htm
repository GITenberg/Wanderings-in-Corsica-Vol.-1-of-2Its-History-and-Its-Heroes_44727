<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>

<hr class="l05" />
<p>
It was in the summer of the past year that I went over to
the island of Corsica. Its unknown solitudes, and the strange
stories I had heard of the country and its inhabitants, tempted
me to make the excursion. But I had no intention of entangling
myself so deeply in its impracticable labyrinths as I actually
did. I fared like the heroes of the fairy-tales, who are
allured by a wondrous bird into some mysterious forest, and
follow it ever farther and farther into the beautiful wilderness.
At last I had wandered over most of the island. The fruit
of that summer is the present book, which I now send home
to my friends. May it not meet with an unsympathetic reception!
It is hoped that at least the history of the Corsicans,
and their popular poetry, entitles it to something better.
</p>

<p>
The history of the Corsicans, all granite like their mountains,
and singularly in harmony with their nature, is in itself
an independent whole; and is therefore capable of being presented,
even briefly, with completeness. It awakens the same
interest of which we are sensible in reading the biography of
an unusually organized man, and would possess valid claims
to our attention even though Corsica could not boast Napoleon
as her offspring. But certainly the history of Napoleon's
native country ought to contribute its share of data to an accurate
estimate of his character; and as the great man is to
be viewed as a result of that history, its claims on our careful
consideration are the more authentic.
</p>

<p>
It is not the object of my book to communicate information
in the sphere of natural science; this is as much beyond its
scope as beyond the abilities of the author. The work has,
however, been written with an earnest purpose.
</p>

<p>
I am under many obligations for literary assistance to the
learned Corsican Benedetto Viale, Professor of Chemistry in
the University of Rome; and it would be difficult for me to
say how helpful various friends were to me in Corsica itself.
My especial thanks are, however, due to the exiled Florentine
geographer, Francesco Marmocchi, and to Camillo Friess,
Archivarius in Ajaccio.

<p>
The oldest notices of Corsica we have, are to be found in
the Greek and Roman historians and geographers. They do
not furnish us with any precise information as to what races
originally colonized the island, whether Ph&oelig;nicians, Etruscans,
or Ligurians. All these ancient races had been occupants
of Corsica before the Carthaginians, the Phocæan Greeks,
and the Romans planted their colonies upon it.
</p>

<p>
The position of the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, in the
great western basin of the Mediterranean, made them points
of convergence for the commerce and colonization of the surrounding
nations of the two continents. To the north, at the
distance of a day's journey, lies Gaul; three days' journey
westwards, Spain; Etruria is close at hand upon the east;
and Africa is but a few days' voyage to the south. The
continental nations necessarily, therefore, came into contact
in these islands, and one after the other left their stamp
upon them. This was particularly the case in Sardinia, a
country entitled to be considered one of the most remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
in Europe, from the variety and complexity of the national
characteristics, and from the multifarious traces left upon it
by so many different races, in buildings, sculptures, coins, language,
and customs, which, deposited, so to speak, in successive
strata, have gradually determined the present ethnographic
conformation of the island. Both Corsica and Sardinia
lie upon the boundary-line which separates the western basin
of the Mediterranean into a Spanish and an Italian half; and
as soon as the influences of Oriental and Greek colonization
had been eradicated politically, if not physically, these two
nations began to exercise their determining power upon the
islands. In Sardinia, the Spanish element predominated; in
Corsica, the Italian. This is very evident at the present day
from the languages. In later times, a third determining
element, but a purely political one&mdash;the French, was added
in the case of Corsica. At a period of the remotest antiquity,
both Spanish and Gallo-Celtic or Ligurian tribes had
passed over to Corsica; but the Spanish characteristics which
struck the philosopher Seneca so forcibly in the Corsicans of
his time, disappeared, except in so far as they are still visible
in the somewhat gloomy and taciturn, and withal choleric disposition
of the present islanders.
</p>

<p>
The most ancient name of the island is Corsica&mdash;a later,
Cyrnus. The former is said to be derived from Corsus, a son
of Hercules, and brother of Sardus, who founded colonies on
the islands, to which they gave their names. Others say that
Corsus was a Trojan, who carried off Sica, a niece of Dido,
and that in honour of her the island received its appellation.
Such is the fable of the oldest Corsican chronicler, Johann
della Grossa.
</p>

<p>
Cyrnus was a name in use among the Greeks. Pausanias
says, in his geography of Phocis: "The island near Sardinia
(Ichnusa) is called by the native Libyans, Corsica; by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
Greeks, Cyrnus." The designation Libyans, is very generally
applied to the Ph&oelig;nicians, and it is highly improbable
that Pausanias was thinking of an aboriginal race. He
viewed them as immigrated colonists, like those in Sardinia.
He says, in the same book, that the Libyans were the first
who came to Sardinia, which they found already inhabited,
and that after them came the Greeks and Hispanians. The
word Cyrnos itself has been derived from the Ph&oelig;nician, <i>Kir</i>&mdash;horn,
promontory. In short, these matters are vague, traditionary,
hypothetical.
</p>

<p>
So much seems to be certain, from the ancient sources
which supplied Pausanias with his information, that in very
early times the Ph&oelig;nicians founded colonies on both islands,
that they found them already inhabited, and that afterwards
an immigration from Spain took place. Seneca, who spent
eight years of exile in Corsica, in his book <i>De Consolatione</i>,
addressed to his mother Helvia, and written from that
island, has the following passage (cap. viii.):&mdash;"This island
has frequently changed its inhabitants. Omitting all that is
involved in the darkness of antiquity, I shall only say that
the Greeks, who at present inhabit Massilia (Marseilles), after
they had left Phocæa, settled at first at Corsica. It is uncertain
what drove them away&mdash;perhaps the unhealthy climate,
the growing power of Italy, or the scarcity of havens; for,
that the savage character of the natives was not the reason,
we learn from their betaking themselves to the then wild and
uncivilized tribes of Gaul. Afterwards, Ligurians crossed
over to the island; and also Hispanians, as may be seen from
the similarity of the modes of life; for the same kinds of
covering for the head and the feet are found here, as among
the Cantabrians&mdash;and there are many resemblances in words;
but the entire language has lost its original character, through
intercourse with the Greeks and Ligurians." It is to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
lamented that Seneca did not consider it worth the pains to
make more detailed inquiry into the condition of the island.
Even for him its earliest history was involved in obscurity;
how much more so must it be for us?
</p>

<p>
Seneca is probably mistaken, however, in not making the
Ligurians and Hispanians arrive on the island till after the
Phocæans. I have no doubt that the Celtic races were the
first and oldest inhabitants of Corsica. The Corsican physiognomy,
even of the present time, appears as a Celtic-Ligurian.

THE GREEKS, ETRUSCANS, CARTHAGINIANS, AND ROMANS IN CORSICA.</h3>

<p>
The first historically accredited event in relation to Corsica,
is that immigration of the fugitive Phocæans definitely mentioned
by Herodotus. We know that these Asiatic Greeks
had resolved rather to quit their native country, than submit to
inevitable slavery under Cyrus, and that, after a solemn oath
to the gods, they carried everything they possessed on board
ship, and put out to sea. They first negotiated with the
Chians for the cession of the &OElig;nusian Islands, but without
success; they then set sail for Corsica, not without a definite
enough aim, as they had already twenty years previously
founded on that island the city of Alalia. They were, accordingly,
received by their own colonists here, and remained with
them five years, "building temples," as Herodotus says;
"but because they made plundering incursions on their
neighbours, the Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians brought sixty
ships into the seas. The Phocæans, on their side, had equipped
a fleet of equal size, and came to an engagement with
them off the coast of Sardinia. They gained a victory, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
it cost them dear; for they lost forty vessels, and the rest had
been rendered useless&mdash;their beaks having been bent. They
returned to Alalia, and taking their wives and children, and
as much of their property as they could, with them, they left
the island of Cyrnus, and sailed to Rhegium." It is well
known that they afterwards founded Massilia, the present
Marseilles.
</p>

<p>
We have therefore in Alalia, the present Aleria&mdash;a colony
of an origin indubitably Greek, though it afterwards fell into
the hands of the Etruscans. The history of this flourishing
commercial people compels us to assume, that, even before
the arrival of the Phocæans, they had founded colonies
in Corsica. It is impossible that the powerful Populonia,
lying so near Corsica on the coast opposite, with Elba
already in its possession, should never have made any attempt
to establish its influence along the eastern shores of
the island. Diodorus says in his fifth book:&mdash;"There are
two notable cities in Corsica&mdash;Calaris and Nicæa; Calaris
(a corruption of Alalia or Aleria) was founded by the Phocæans.
These were expelled by the Tyrrhenians, after they
had been some time in the island. The Tyrrhenians founded
Nicæa, when they became masters of the sea." Nicæa is
probably the modern Mariana, which lies on the same level
region of the coast. We may assume that this colony existed
contemporaneously with Alalia, and that the immigration of
the entire community of Phocæans excited jealousy and alarm
in the Tyrrhenians, whence the collision between them and
the Greeks. It is uncertain whether the Carthaginians had
at this period possessions in Corsica; but they had colonies
in the neighbouring Sardinia. Pausanias tells us that they
subjugated the Libyans and Hispanians on this island, and
built the two cities of Caralis (Cagliari) and Sulchos (Palma di
Solo). The threatened danger from the Greeks now induced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
them to make common cause with the Tyrrhenians, who also
had settlements in Sardinia, against the Phocæan intruders.
Ancient writers further mention an immigration of Corsicans
into Sardinia, where they are said to have founded twelve cities.
</p>

<p>
For a considerable period we now hear nothing more about
the fortunes of Corsica, from which the Etruscans continued
to draw supplies of honey, wax, timber for ship-building, and
slaves. Their power gradually sank, and they gave way to
the Carthaginians, who seem to have put themselves in complete
possession of both islands&mdash;that is, of their emporiums
and havens&mdash;for the tribes of the interior had yielded to no
foe. During the Punic Wars, the conquering Romans deprived
the Carthaginians in their turn of both islands. Corsica
is at first not named, either in the Punic treaty of the time of
Tarquinius, or in the conditions of peace at the close of the
first Punic War. Sardinia had been ceded to the Romans;
the vicinity of Corsica could not but induce them to make
themselves masters of that island also; both, lying in the
centre of a sea which washed the shores of Spain, Gaul, Italy,
and Africa, afforded the greatest facilities for establishing
stations directed towards the coasts of all the countries which
Rome at that time was preparing to subdue.
</p>

<p>
We are informed, that in the year 260 before the birth of
Christ, the Consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio crossed over to
Corsica, and destroyed the city of Aleria, and that he conquered
at once the Corsicans, Sardinians, and the Carthaginian
Hanno. The mutilated inscription on the tomb of
Scipio has the words&mdash;<span class="smcap"><span lang='la'>Hec cepit Corsica Aleriaque vrbe</span></span>.
But the subjugation of the wild Corsicans was no easy
matter. They made a resistance as heroic as that of the
Samnites. We even find that the Romans suffered a number
of defeats, and that the Corsicans several times rebelled.
In the year 240, M. Claudius led an army against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
the Corsicans. Defeated, and in a situation of imminent danger,
he offered them favourable conditions. They accepted
them, but the Senate refused to confirm the treaty. It ordered
the Consul, C. Licinius Varus, to chastise the Corsicans, delivering
Claudius at the same time into their hands, that they
might do with him as they chose. This was frequently the
policy of the Romans, when they wished to quiet their religious
scruples about an oath. The Corsicans did as the Spaniards
and Samnites had done in similar instances. They would not
receive the innocent general, and sent him back unharmed.
On his return to Rome, he was strangled, and thrown upon
the Gemonian stairs.
</p>

<p>
Though subdued by the Romans, the Corsicans were continually
rising anew, already exhibiting that patriotism and
love of freedom which in much later times drew the eyes of
the world on this little isolated people. They rebelled at the
same time with the Sardinians; but when these had been
conquered, the Corsicans also were obliged to submit to the
Consul Caius Papirus, who defeated them in the bloody battle
of the "Myrtle-field." But they regained a footing in the
mountain strongholds, and it appears that they forced the
Roman commander to an advantageous peace.
</p>

<p>
They rose again in the year 181. Marcus Pinarius, Prætor
of Sardinia, immediately landed in Corsica with an army,
and defeated the islanders with dreadful carnage in a battle
of which Livy gives an account&mdash;they lost two thousand men
killed. The Corsicans submitted, gave hostages and a tribute
of one hundred thousand pounds of wax. Seven years
later, a new insurrection and other bloody battles&mdash;seven
thousand Corsicans were slain, and two thousand taken prisoners.
The tribute was raised to two hundred thousand
pounds of wax. Ten years afterwards, this heroic people is
again in arms, compelling the Romans to send out a consular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
army: Juventius Thalea, and after him Scipio Nasica, completed
the subjugation of the island in the year 162.
</p>

<p>
The Romans had thus to fight with these islanders for more
than a hundred years, before they reduced them to subjection.
Corsica was governed in common with Sardinia by a Prætor,
who resided in Cagliari, and sent a <span lang='la'><i>legatus</i></span> or lieutenant to
Corsica. But it was not till the time of the first civil war,
that the Romans began to entertain serious thoughts of colonizing
the island. The celebrated Marius founded, on the
beautiful level of the east coast, the city of Mariana; and
Sulla afterwards built on the same plain the city of Aleria,
restoring the old Alalia of the Phocæans. Corsica now began
to be Romanized, to modify its Celtic-Spanish language, and
to adopt Roman customs. We do not hear that the Corsicans
again ventured to rebel against their masters; and the island
is only once more mentioned in Roman history, when Sextus
Pompey, defying the triumvirs, establishes a maritime power
in the Mediterranean, and takes possession of Corsica, Sardinia,
and Sicily. His empire was of short duration.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />
<br />

STATE OF THE ISLAND DURING THE ROMAN PERIOD.
</h3>

<p>
The nature of its interior prevents us from believing that
the condition of the island was by any means so flourishing during
the long periods of its subjection to the Romans, as some
writers are disposed to assume. They contented themselves,
as it appears, with the two colonies mentioned, and the establishment
of some ports. The beautiful coast opposite Italy
was the region mainly cultivated. They had only made a
single road in Corsica. According to the Itinerary of Antonine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
this Roman road led from Mariana along the coast
southwards to Aleria, to Præsidium, Portus Favoni, and
Palæ, on the straits, near the modern Bonifazio. This was
the usual place for crossing to Sardinia, in which the road
was continued from Portus Tibulæ (<span lang='la'><i>cartio Aragonese</i></span>)&mdash;a
place of some importance, to Caralis, the present Cagliari.
</p>

<p>
Pliny speaks of thirty-three towns in Corsica, but mentions
only the two colonies by name. Strabo, again, who wrote not
long before him, says of Corsica: "It contains some cities of
no great size, as Blesino, Charax, Eniconæ, and Vapanes."
These names are to be found in no other writer. Pliny has
probably made every fort a town. Ptolemy, however, gives
the localities of Corsica in detail, with the appellations of the
tribes inhabiting them; many of his names still survive in
Corsica unaltered, or easily recognised.
</p>

<p>
The ancient authors have left us some notices of the character
of the country and people during this Roman period.
I shall give them here, as it is interesting to compare what
they say with the accounts we have of Corsica in the Middle
Ages and at the present time.
</p>

<p>
Strabo says of Corsica: "It is thinly inhabited, for it is a
rugged country, and in most places has no practicable roads.
Hence those who inhabit the mountains live by plunder, and
are more untameable than wild beasts. When the Roman
generals have made an expedition against the island, and
taken their strongholds, they bring away with them a great
number of slaves, and then people in Rome may see with astonishment,
what fierce and utterly savage creatures these
are. For they either take away their own lives, or they tire
their master by their obstinate disobedience and stupidity, so
that he rues his bargain, though he have bought them for the
veriest trifle."
</p>

<p>
Diodorus: "When the Tyrrhenians had the Corsican cities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
in their possession, they demanded from the natives tribute of
resin, wax, and honey, which are here produced in abundance.
The Corsican slaves are of great excellence, and seem to be
preferable to other slaves for the common purposes of life.
The whole broad island is for the most part mountainous,
rich in shady woods, watered by little rivers. The inhabitants
live on milk, honey, and flesh, all which they have in
plenty. The Corsicans are just towards each other, and live
in a more civilized manner than all other barbarians. For
when honey-combs are found in the woods, they belong without
dispute to the first finder. The sheep, being distinguished
by certain marks, remain safe, even although their master
does not guard them. Also in the regulation of the rest of
their life, each one in his place observes the laws of rectitude
with wonderful faithfulness. They have a custom at the birth
of a child which is most strange and new; for no care is
taken of a woman in child-birth; but instead of her, the husband
lays himself for some days as if sick and worn out in
bed. Much boxwood grows there, and that of no mean sort.
From this arises the great bitterness of the honey. The
island is inhabited by barbarians, whose speech is strange and
hard to be understood. The number of the inhabitants is
more than thirty thousand."
</p>

<p>
Seneca: "For, leaving out of account such places as by the
pleasantness of the region, and their advantageous situation,
allure great numbers, go to remote spots on rude islands&mdash;go to
Sciathus, and Seriphus, and Gyarus, and Corsica, and you will
find no place of banishment where some one or other does not
reside for his own pleasure. Where shall we find anything
so naked, so steep and rugged on every side, as this rocky
island? Where is there a land in respect of its products
scantier, in respect of its people more inhospitable, in respect
of its situation more desolate, or in respect of its climate more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
unhealthy? And yet there live here more foreigners than
natives."
</p>

<p>
According to the accounts of the oldest writers, we must
doubtless believe that Corsica was in those times to a very
great extent uncultivated, and, except in the matter of wood,
poor in natural productions. That Seneca exaggerates is
manifest, and is to be explained from the situation in which
he wrote. Strabo and Diodorus are of opposite opinions as to
the character of the Corsican slaves. The former has in his
favour the history and unvarying character of the Corsicans,
who have ever shown themselves in the highest degree incapable
of slavery, and Strabo could have pronounced on them
no fairer eulogy than in speaking of them as he has done.
What Diodorus, who writes as if more largely informed, says
of the Corsican sense of justice, is entirely true, and is confirmed
by the experience of every age.
</p>

<p>
Among the epigrams on Corsica ascribed to Seneca, there
is one which says of the Corsicans: Their first law is to revenge
themselves, their second to live by plunder, their third
to lie, and their fourth to deny the gods.
</p>

<p>
This is all the information of importance we have from the
Greeks and Romans on the subject of Corsica.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p2" />

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />
<br />

COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEDIÆVAL PERIOD.
</h3>

<p>
Corsica remained in the possession of the Romans, from
whom in later times it received the Christian religion, till the
fall of Rome made it once more a prey to the rovers by land
and sea. Here, again, we have new inundations of various
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
tribes, and a motley mixture of nations, languages, and customs,
as in the earliest period.
</p>

<p>
Germans, Byzantine Greeks, Moors, Romanized races appear
successively in Corsica. But the Romanic stamp, impressed
by the Romans and strengthened by bands of fugitive
Italians, has already taken its place as an indelible and leading
trait in Corsican character. The Vandals came to Corsica
under Genseric, and maintained themselves in the island a
long time, till they were expelled by Belisarius. After the
Goths and Longobards had in their turn invaded the island
and been its masters, it fell, along with Sardinia, into the
hands of the Byzantines, and remained in their possession
nearly two hundred years. It was during this period that
numerous Greek names and roots, still to be met with throughout
the country and in the language, originated.
</p>

<p>
The Greek rule was of the Turkish kind. They appeared
to look upon the Corsicans as a horde of savages; they loaded
them with impossible exactions, and compelled them to sell
their very children in order to raise the enormous tribute. A
period of incessant fighting now begins for Corsica, and the
history of the nation consists for centuries in one uninterrupted
struggle for existence and freedom.
</p>

<p>
The first irruption of the Saracens occurred in 713. Ever
since Spain had become Moorish, the Mahommedans had been
scouring the Mediterranean, robbing and plundering in all the
islands, and founding in many places a dominion of protracted
duration. The Greek Emperors, whose hands were full in the
East, totally abandoned the West, which found new protectors
in the Franks. That Charlemagne had to do with Corsica or
with the Moors there, appears from his historian Eginhard,
who states that the Emperor sent out a fleet under Count
Burkhard, to defend Corsica against the Saracens. His son
Charles gave them a defeat at Mariana. These struggles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
with the Moors are still largely preserved in the traditions of
the Corsican people. The Roman noble, Hugo Colonna, a
rebel against Pope Stephen IV., who sent him to Corsica with
a view to rid himself of him and his two associates, Guido
Savelli and Amondo Nasica, figures prominently in the Moorish
wars. Colonna's first achievement was the taking of Aleria,
after a triple combat of a romantic character, between three
chivalrous paladins and as many Moorish knights. He then
defeated the Moorish prince Nugalon, near Mariana, and
forced all the heathenish people in the island to submit to the
rite of baptism. The comrade of this Hugo Colonna was, according
to the Corsican chronicler, a nephew of Ganelon of
Mayence, also named Ganelon, who had come to Corsica to
wipe off the disgrace of his house in Moorish blood.
</p>

<p>
The Tuscan margrave, Bonifacius, after a great naval
victory over the Saracens on the coast of Africa, near Utica, is
now said to have landed at the southern extremity of Corsica
on his return home, and to have built a fortress on the chalk
cliffs there, which received from its founder the name of Bonifazio.
This took place in the year 833. Louis the Pious
granted him the feudal lordship of Corsica. Etruria thus
acquires supremacy over the neighbouring island a second
time, and it is certain that the Tuscan margraves continued
to govern Corsica till the death of Lambert, the last of their
line, in 951.
</p>

<p>
Berengarius, and after him Adalbert of Friuli, were the
next masters of the island; then the Emperor Otto II. gave
it to his adherent, the Margrave Hugo of Toscana. No further
historical details can be arrived at with any degree of precision
till the period when the city of Pisa obtained supremacy
in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
In these times, and up till the beginning of the eleventh
century, a fierce and turbulent nobility had been forming in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
Corsica, as in Italy&mdash;the various families of which held sway
throughout the island. This aristocracy was only in a very
limited degree of native origin. Italian magnates who had
fled from the barbarians, Longobard, Gothic, Greek or Frankish
vassals, soldiers who had earned for themselves land and
feudal title by their exertions in the wars against the Moors,
gradually founded houses and hereditary seigniories. The
Corsican chronicler makes all the seigniors spring from the
Roman knight Hugo Colonna and his companions. He makes
him Count of Corsica, and traces to his son Cinarco the origin
of the most celebrated family of the old Corsican nobility, the
Cinarchesi; to another son, Bianco, that of the Biancolacci;
to Pino, a son of Savelli's, the Pinaschi; and in the same way
we have Amondaschi, Rollandini, descendants of Ganelon
and others. In later times various families emerged into distinction
from this confusion of petty tyrants, the Gentili, and
Signori da Mare on Cape Corso; beyond the mountains, the
seigniors of Leca, of Istria, and Rocca, and those of Ornans
and of Bozio.

FEUDALISM IN CORSICA&mdash;THE LEGISLATOR SAMBUCUCCIO.
</h3>

<p>
For a long period the history of the Corsicans presents nothing
but a bloody picture of the tyranny of the barons over
the lower orders, and the quarrels of these nobles with each
other. The coasts became desolate, the old cities of Aleria
and Mariana were gradually forsaken; the inhabitants of the
maritime districts fled from the Saracens higher up into the
hills, where they built villages, strengthened by nature and
art so as to resist the corsairs and the barons. In few countries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
can the feudal nobility have been so fierce and cruel as
in Corsica. In the midst of a half barbarous and quite poor
population, Nature around them savage as themselves, unchecked
by any counterpoise of social morality or activity, unbridled
by the Church, cut off from the world and civilizing
intercourse&mdash;let the reader imagine these nobles lording it in
their rocky fastnesses, and, giving the rein to their restless
and unsettled natures in sensuality and violence. In other
countries all that was humanizing, submissive to law, positive
and not destructive in tendency, collected itself in the cities,
organized itself into guilds and corporate bodies, and uniting
in a civic league, made head against the aristocracy. But it
was extremely difficult to accomplish anything like this in
Corsica, where trade and manufactures were unknown, where
there were neither cities nor a commercial middle-class. All
the more note-worthy is the phenomenon, that a nation of
rude peasants should, in a manner reminding us of patriarchal
times, have succeeded in forming itself into a democracy of a
marked and distinctive character.
</p>

<p>
The barons of the country, engaged in continual wars with
the oppressed population of the villages, and fighting with
each other for sole supremacy, had submitted at the beginning
of the eleventh century to one of their own number, the lord
of Cinarca, who aimed at making himself tyrant of the whole
island. Scanty as our materials for drawing a conclusion are,
we must infer from what we know, that the Corsicans of the
interior had hitherto maintained a desperate resistance to the
barons. In danger of being crushed by Cinarca, the people
assembled to a general council. It is the first Parliament of
the Corsican Commons of which we hear in their history, and
it was held in Morosaglia. On this occasion they chose a
brave and able man to be their leader, Sambucuccio of Alando,
with whom begins the long series of Corsican patriots, who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
have earned renown by their love of country and heroic
courage.
</p>

<p>
Sambucuccio gained a victory over Cinarca, and compelled
him to retire within his own domains. As a means of securing
and extending the advantage thus gained, he organized a
confederacy, as was done in Switzerland under similar circumstances,
though somewhat later. All the country between
Aleria, Calvi, and Brando, formed itself into a free commonwealth,
taking the title of Terra del Commune, which it has
retained till very recently. The constitution of this commonwealth,
simple and entirely democratic in its character, was
based upon the natural divisions of the country. These arise
from its mountain-system, which separates the island into a
series of valleys. As a general rule, the collective hamlets
in a valley form a parish, called at the present day, as in the
earliest times, by the Italian name, <span lang='it_IT'><i>pieve</i></span> (plebs). Each <span lang='it_IT'><i>pieve</i></span>,
therefore, included a certain number of little communities
(paese); and each of these, in its popular assembly, elected a
presiding magistrate, or <span lang='it_IT'><i>podestà</i></span>, with two or more Fathers of
the Community (<span lang='it_IT'><i>padri del commune</i></span>), probably, as was customary
in later times, holding office for a single year. The
Fathers of the Community were to be worthy of the name;
they were to exercise a fatherly care over the welfare of their
respective districts; they were to maintain peace, and shield
the defenceless. In a special assembly of their own they
chose an official, with the title <span lang='it_IT'><i>caporale</i></span>, who seems to have
been invested with the functions of a tribune of the Commons,
and was expressly intended to defend the rights of the people
in every possible way. The podestàs, again, in their assembly,
had the right of choosing the <span lang='it_IT'><i>Dodici</i></span> or Council of Twelve&mdash;the
highest legislative body in the confederacy.
</p>

<p>
However imperfect and confused in point of date our information
on the subject of Sambucuccio and his enactments
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
may be, still we gather from it the certainty that the
Corsicans, even at that early period, were able by their own
unaided energies to construct for themselves a democratic
commonwealth. The seeds thus planted could never afterwards
be eradicated, but continued to develop themselves
under all the storms that assailed them, ennobling the rude
vigour of a spirited and warlike people, encouraging through
every period an unexampled patriotism, and a heroic love of
freedom, and making it possible that, at a time when the great
nations in the van of European culture lay prostrate under
despotic forms of government, Corsica should have produced
the democratic constitution of Pasquale Paoli, which originated
before North America freed herself, and when the French
Revolution had not begun. Corsica had no slaves, no serfs;
every Corsican was free. He shared in the political life of his
country through the self-government of his commune, and the
popular assemblies&mdash;and this, in conjunction with the sense
of justice, and the love of country, is the necessary condition
of political liberty in general. The Corsicans, as Diodorus
mentions to their honour, were not deficient in the sense of
justice; but conflicting interests within their island, and the
foreign tyrannies to which, from their position and small numbers,
they were constantly exposed, prevented them from ever
arriving at prosperity as a State.

THE PISANS IN CORSICA.
</h3>

<p>
The legislator Sambucuccio fared as many other legislators
have done. His death was a sudden and severe blow to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
his enactments. The seigniors immediately issued from their
castles, and spread war and discord over the land. The
people, looking round for help, besought the Tuscan margrave
Malaspina to rescue them, and placed themselves under his
protection. Malaspina landed on the island with a body of
troops, defeated the barons, and restored peace. This happened
about the year 1020, and the Malaspinas appear to have
remained rulers of the Terra del Commune till 1070, while
the seigniors bore sway in the rest of the country. At this
time, too, the Pope, who pretended to derive his rights from
the Frankish kings, interfered in the affairs of the island. It
would even seem that he assumed the position of its feudal
superior, and that Malaspina was Count of Corsica by the
papal permission. The Corsican bishoprics furnished him with
another means of establishing his influence in the island. The
number of these had in the course of time increased to six,
Aleria, Ajaccio, Accia, Mariana, Nebbio, and Sagona.
</p>

<p>
Gregory VII. sent Landulph, Bishop of Pisa, to Corsica, to
persuade the people to put themselves under the power of
the Church. This having been effected, Gregory, and then
Urban II., in the year 1098, granted the perpetual feudal
superiority of the island to the bishopric of Pisa, now raised
to an archbishopric. The Pisans, therefore, became masters
of the island, and they maintained a precarious possession
of it, in the face of continual resistance, for nearly a hundred
years.
</p>

<p>
Their government was wise, just, and benevolent, and is
eulogized by all the Corsican historians. They exerted themselves
to bring the country under cultivation, and to improve
the natural products of the soil. They rebuilt towns, erected
bridges, made roads, built towers along the coast, and introduced
even art into the island, at least in so far as regarded
church architecture. The best old churches in Corsica are of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19'>[19]</a></span>
Pisan origin, and may be instantly recognised as such from the
elegance of their style. Every two years the republic of Pisa
sent as their representative to the island, a Giudice, or judge,
who governed and administered justice in the name of the
city. The communal arrangements of Sambucuccio were not
altered.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Genoa had been watching with jealous eyes the
progress of Pisan ascendency in the adjacent island, and could
not persuade herself to allow her rival undisputed possession
of so advantageous a station in the Mediterranean, immediately
before the gates of Genoa. Even when Urban II. had
made Pisa the metropolitan see of the Corsican bishops, the
Genoese had protested, and they several times compelled the
popes to withdraw the Pisan investiture. At length, in the
year 1133, Pope Innocent II. yielded to the urgent solicitations
of the Genoese, and divided the investiture, subordinating
to Genoa, now also made an archbishopric, the Corsican
bishops of Mariana, Accia, and Nebbio, while Pisa retained
the bishoprics of Aleria, Ajaccio, and Sagona. But the
Genoese were not satisfied with this; they aimed at secular
supremacy over the whole island. Constantly at war with
Pisa, they seized a favourable opportunity of surprising Bonifazio,
when the inhabitants of the town were celebrating a
marriage festival. Honorius III. was obliged to confirm them
in the possession of this important place in the year 1217.
They fortified the impregnable cliff, and made it the fulcrum
of their influence in the island; they granted the city
commercial and other privileges, and induced a great number
of Genoese families to settle there. Bonifazio thus became
the first Genoese colony in Corsica.

PISA OR GENOA?&mdash;GIUDICE DELLA ROCCA.
</h3>

<p>
Corsica was now rent into factions. One section of the
inhabitants inclined to Pisa, another to Genoa, many of the
seigniors maintained an independent position, and the Terra
del Commune kept itself apart. The Pisans, though hard
pressed by their powerful foes in Italy, were still unwilling
to give up Corsica. They made an islander of the old family
of Cinarca, their Lieutenant and Giudice, and committed to
him the defence of his country against Genoa.
</p>

<p>
This man's name was Sinucello, and he became famous
under the appellation of Giudice della Rocca. His patriotism
and heroic courage, his wisdom and love of justice, have given
him a place among those who in barbarous times have distinguished
themselves by their individual excellencies. The
Cinarchesi, it is said, had been driven by one of the papal
margraves to Sardinia. Sinucello was a descendant of the
exiled family. He had gone to Pisa and attained to eminence
in the service of the republic. The hopes of the Pisans were
now centred in him. They made him Count and Judge of
the island, gave him some ships, and sent him to Corsica in
the year 1280. He succeeded, with the aid of his adherents
there, in overpowering the Genoese party among the seigniors,
and restoring the Pisan ascendency. The Genoese sent
Thomas Spinola with troops. Spinola suffered a severe defeat
at the hands of Giudice. The war continued many years,
Giudice carrying it on with indefatigable vigour in the name
of the Pisan republic; but after the Genoese had won against
the Pisans the great naval engagement at Meloria, in which
the ill-fated Ugolino commanded, the power of the Pisans
declined, and Corsica was no longer to be maintained.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>[21]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After the victory the Genoese made themselves masters of
the east coast of Corsica. They intrusted the subjugation of
the island, and the expulsion of the brave Giudice, to their
General Luchetto Doria. But Doria too found himself severely
handled by his opponent; and for years this able man
continued to make an effectual resistance, keeping at bay both
the Genoese and the seigniors of the island, which seemed
now to have fallen into a state of complete anarchy. Giudice
is one of the favourite national heroes of the chroniclers: they
throw an air of the marvellous round his noble and truly Corsican
figure, and tell romantic stories of his long-continued
struggles. However unimportant these may be in a historical
point of view, still they are characteristic of the period,
the country, and the men. Giudice had six daughters, who
were married to persons of high rank in the island. His bitter
enemy, Giovanninello, had also six daughters, equally well
married. The six sons-in-law of the latter form a conspiracy
against Giudice, and in one night kill seventy fighting men
of his retainers. This gives rise to a separation of the entire
island into two parties, and a feud like that between the
Guelphs and Ghibellines, which lasts for two hundred years.
Giovanninello was driven to Genoa: returning, however, soon
after, he built the fortress of Calvi, which immediately threw
itself into the hands of the Genoese, and became the second
of their colonies in the island. The chroniclers have much
to say of Giudice's impartial justice, as well as of his clemency,&mdash;as,
for example, the following. He had once taken
a great many Genoese prisoners, and he promised their freedom
to all those who had wives, only these wives were to
come over themselves and fetch their husbands. They came;
but a nephew of Giudice's forced a Genoese woman to spend
a night with him. His uncle had him beheaded on the spot,
and sent the captives home according to his promise. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
see how such a man should have been by preference called
Giudice&mdash;judge; since among a barbarous people, and in barbarous
times, the character of judge must unite in itself all
virtue and all other authority.
</p>

<p>
In his extreme old age Giudice grew blind. A disagreement
arose between the blind old man and his natural son
Salnese, who, having treacherously got him into his power,
delivered him into the hands of the Genoese. When Giudice
was being conducted on board the ship that was to convey
him to Genoa, he threw himself upon his knees on the shore,
and solemnly imprecated a curse on his son Salnese, and all
his posterity. Giudice della Rocca was thrown into a miserable
Genoese dungeon, and died in Genoa in the tower of Malapaga,
in the year 1312. The Corsican historian Filippini, describes
him as one of the most remarkable men the island has produced;
he was brave, skilful in the use of arms, singularly
rapid in the execution of his designs, wise in council, impartial
in administering justice, liberal to his friends, and firm in
adversity&mdash;qualities which almost all distinguished Corsicans
have possessed. With Giudice fell the last remains of Pisan
ascendency in Corsica.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />
<br />

COMMENCEMENT OF GENOESE SUPREMACY&mdash;CORSICAN COMMUNISTS.
</h3>

<p>
Pisa made a formal surrender of the island to Genoa, and
thirty years after the death of Giudice, the Terra del Commune,
and the greater number of the seigniors submitted to
the Genoese supremacy. The Terra sent four messengers to
the Genoese Senate, and tendered its submission under the
condition, that the Corsicans should pay no further tax than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
twenty soldi for each hearth. The Senate accepted the condition,
and in 1348 the first Genoese governor landed in the
island. It was Boccaneria, a man who is praised for his vigour
and prudence, and who, during his single year of power,
gave the country peace. But he had scarcely returned from
his post, when the factions raised their heads anew, and
plunged the country into the wildest anarchy. From the first
the rights of Genoa had not been undisputed, Boniface VIII.
having in 1296, in virtue of the old feudal claims of the papal
chair, granted the superiority of Corsica and Sardinia to King
James of Arragon. A new foreign power, therefore&mdash;Spain,
connected with Corsica at a period of hoary antiquity&mdash;seemed
now likely to seek a footing on the island; and in the meantime,
though no overt attempt at conquest had been made,
those Corsicans who refused allegiance to Genoa, found a
point of support in the House of Arragon.
</p>

<p>
The next epoch of Corsican history exhibits a series of the
most sanguinary conflicts between the seigniors and Genoa.
Such confusion had arisen immediately on the death of Giudice,
and the people were reduced to such straits, that the
chronicler wonders why, in the wretched state of the country,
the population did not emigrate in a body. The barons, as
soon as they no longer felt the heavy hand of Giudice, used
their power most tyrannously, some as independent lords, others
as tributary to Genoa&mdash;all sought to domineer, to extort. The
entire dissolution of social order produced a sect of Communists,
extravagant enthusiasts, who appeared contemporaneously
in Italy. This sect, an extraordinary phenomenon
in the wild Corsica, became notorious and dreaded under the
name of the Giovannali. It took its rise in the little district
of Carbini, on the other side the hills. Its originators were
bastard sons of Guglielmuccio, two brothers, Polo and Arrigo,
seigniors of Attalà. "Among these people," relates the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>[24]</a></span>
chronicler, "the women were as the men; and it was one of
their laws that all things should be in common, the wives
and children as well as other possessions. Perhaps they
wished to renew that golden age of which the poets feign
that it ended with the reign of Saturn. These Giovannali
performed certain penances after their fashion, and assembled
at night in the churches, where, in going through their
superstitious rites and false ceremonies, they concealed the
lights, and, in the foulest and the most disgraceful manner,
took pleasure the one with the other, according as they were
inclined. It was Polo who led this devilish crew of sectaries,
which began to increase marvellously, not only on this side
the mountains, but also everywhere beyond them."
</p>

<p>
The Pope, at that time residing in France, excommunicated
the sect; he sent a commissary with soldiers to Corsica, who
gave the Giovannali, now joined by many seigniors, a defeat
in the Pieve Alesani, where they had raised a fortress.
Wherever a Giovannalist was found, he was killed on the
spot. The phenomenon is certainly remarkable; possibly the
idea originally came from Italy, and it is hardly to be wondered
at, if among the poor distracted Corsicans, who considered
human equality as something natural and inalienable,
it found, as the chronicler tells us, an extended reception.
Religious enthusiasm, or fanatic extravagance, never at any
other time took root among the Corsicans; and the island
was never priest-ridden: it was spared at least this plague.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />
<br />

STRUGGLES WITH GENOA&mdash;ARRIGO DELLA ROCCA.
</h3>

<p>
The people themselves, driven to desperation after the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span>
departure of Boccaneria, begged the assistance of Genoa. The
republic accordingly sent Tridano della Torre to the island.
He mastered the barons, and ruled seven full years vigorously
and in peace.
</p>

<p>
The second man of mark from the family of Cinarca or
Rocca, now appears upon the stage, Arrigo della Rocca&mdash;young,
energetic, impetuous, born to rule, as stubborn as Giudice,
equally inexhaustible in resource and powerful in fight. His
father, Guglielmo, had fought against the Genoese, and had
been slain. The son took up the contest. Unfortunate at
first, he left his native country and went to Spain, offering his
services to the House of Arragon, and inciting its then representatives
to lay claim to those rights which had already been
acknowledged by the Pope. Tridano had been murdered
during Arrigo's absence, the seigniors had rebelled, the
island had split into two parties&mdash;the Caggionacci and the
Ristiagnacci, and a tumult of the bloodiest kind had broken
out.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1392, Arrigo della Rocca appeared in Corsica
almost without followers, and as if on a private adventure,
but no sooner had he shown himself, than the people flocked
to his standard. Lionello Lomellino and Aluigi Tortorino
were then governors, two at once in those unsettled times.
They called a diet at Corte, counselled and exhorted. Meanwhile,
Arrigo had marched rapidly on Cinarca, routing the
Genoese troops wherever they came in their way; immediately
he was at the gates of Biguglia, the residence of the
governors; he stormed the place, assembled the people, and
had himself proclaimed Count of Corsica. The governors
retired in dismay to Genoa, leaving the whole country in the
hands of the Corsicans, except Calvi, Bonifazio, and San
Columbano.
</p>

<p>
Arrigo governed the island for four years without molestation&mdash;energetically,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
impartially, but with cruelty. He caused
great numbers to be beheaded, not sparing even his own
relations. Perhaps some were imbittered by this severity&mdash;perhaps
it was the inveterate tendency to faction in the Corsican
character, that now began to manifest itself in a certain
degree of disaffection.
</p>

<p>
The seigniors of Cape Corso rose first, with the countenance
of Genoa; but they were unsuccessful&mdash;with an iron arm
Arrigo crushed every revolt. He carried in his banner a
griffin over the arms of Arragon, to indicate that he had
placed the island under the protection of Spain.
</p>

<p>
Genoa was embarrassed. She had fought many a year now
for Corsica, and had gained nothing. The critical position of
her affairs tied the hands of the Republic, and she seemed
about to abandon Corsica. Five <i>Nobili</i>, however, at this
juncture, formed themselves into a sort of joint-stock company,
and prevailed upon the Senate to hand the island over to
them, the supremacy being still reserved for the Republic.
These were the Signori Magnera, Tortorino, Fiscone, Taruffo,
and Lomellino; they named their company "The Mahona,"
and each of them bore the title of Governor of Corsica.
</p>

<p>
They appeared in the island at the head of a thousand
men, and found the party discontented with Arrigo, awaiting
them. They effected little; were, in fact, reduced to such
extremity by their energetic opponent, that they thought it
necessary to come to terms with him. Arrigo agreed to their
proposals, but in a short time again took up arms, finding
himself trifled with; he defeated the Genoese <i>Nobili</i> in a
bloody battle, and cleared the island of the Mahona. A second
expedition which the Republic now sent was more successful.
Arrigo was compelled once more to quit Corsica.
</p>

<p>
He went a second time to Spain, and asked support from
King John of Arragon. John readily gave him two galleys
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'>[27]</a></span>
and some soldiers, and after an absence of two months the
stubborn Corsican appeared once more on his native soil.
Zoaglia, the Genoese governor, was not a match for him;
Arrigo took him prisoner, and made himself master of the
whole island, with the exception of the fortresses of Calvi
and Bonifazio. This occurred in 1394. The Republic sent
new commanders and new troops. What the sword could not
do, poison at last accomplished. Arrigo della Rocca died
suddenly in the year 1401. Just at this time Genoa yielded
to Charles VI. of France. The fortunes of Corsica seemed
about to take a new turn; this aspect of affairs, however,
proved, in the meantime, transitory. The French king
named Lionello Lomellino feudal count of the island. He is
the same who was mentioned as a member of the Mahona,
and it is to him Corsica owes the founding of her largest city,
Bastia, to which the residence of the Governors was now removed
from the neighbouring Castle of Biguglia.

VINCENTELLO D'ISTRIA.
</h3>

<p>
A man of a similar order began now to take the place of
Arrigo della Rocca. Making their appearance constantly at
similar political junctures, these bold Corsicans bear an astonishing
resemblance to each other; they form an unbroken
series of undaunted, indefatigable, even tragic heroes, from
Giudice della Rocca, to Pasquale Paoli and Napoleon, and
their history&mdash;if we except the last notable name&mdash;is identical
in its general character and final issue, as the struggle
of the island against the Genoese rule remains throughout
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>[28]</a></span>
centuries one and the same. The commencement of the
career of these men, who all emerge from banishment, has
each time a tinge of the romantic and adventurous.
</p>

<p>
Vincentello d'Istria was a nephew of Arrigo's, son of one of
his sisters and Ghilfuccio a noble Corsican. Like his uncle, he
had in his youth attached himself to the court of Arragon, had
entered into the Arragonese service, and distinguished himself
by splendid deeds of arms. Later, having procured the command
of some Arragonese ships, he had conducted a successful
corsair warfare against the Genoese, and made his name
the terror of the Mediterranean. He resolved to take advantage
of the favourable position of affairs, and attempt a landing
in his native island, where Count Lomellino had drawn
odium on himself by his harsh government, and Francesco
della Rocca, natural son of Arrigo, who ruled the Terra del
Commune in the name of Genoa, as vice-count, was vainly
struggling with a formidable opposition.
</p>

<p>
Vincentello landed unexpectedly in Sagona, marched rapidly
to Cinarca, exactly as his uncle had done, took Biguglia,
assembled the people, and made himself Count of Corsica.
Francesco della Rocca immediately fell by the hand of an
assassin; but his sister, Violanta&mdash;a woman of masculine
energy, took up arms, and made a brave resistance, though
at length obliged to yield. Bastia surrendered. Genoa now
sent troops with all speed; after a struggle of two years,
Vincentello was compelled to leave the island&mdash;a number of
the selfish seigniors having made common cause with Genoa.
</p>

<p>
In a short time, Vincentello returned with Arragonese
soldiers, and again he wrested the entire island from the
Genoese, with the exception of Calvi and Bonifazio. When
he had succeeded thus far, Alfonso, the young king of Arragon,
more enterprising than his predecessors, and having
equipped a powerful fleet, prepared in his own person to make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
good the presumed Arragonese rights on the island by force
of arms. He sailed from Sardinia in 1420, anchored before
Calvi, and forced this Genoese city to surrender. He then
sailed to Bonifazio; and while the Corsicans of his party laid
siege to the impregnable fortress on the land side, he himself
attacked it from the sea. The siege of Bonifazio is an episode
of great interest in these tedious struggles, and was rendered
equally remarkable by the courage of the besiegers, and the
heroism of the besieged. The latter, true to Genoa to the
last drop of blood&mdash;themselves to a great extent of Genoese
extraction&mdash;remained immoveable as their own rocks; and
neither hunger, pestilence, nor the fire and sword of the
Spaniards, broke their spirit during that long and distressing
blockade. Every attempt to storm the town was unsuccessful;
women, children, monks and priests, stood in arms
upon the walls, and fought beside the citizens. For months
they continued the struggle, expecting relief from Genoa, till
the Spanish pride of Alfonso was at length humbled, and he
drew off, weary and ashamed, leaving to Vincentello the prosecution
of the siege. Relief came, however, and delivered
the exhausted town on the very eve of its fall.
</p>

<p>
Vincentello retreated; and as Calvi had again fallen into
the hands of the Genoese, the Republic had the support of both
these strong towns. King Alfonso made no further attempt
to obtain possession of Corsica. Vincentello, now reduced to his
own resources, gradually lost ground; the intrigues of Genoa
effecting more than her arms, and the dissensions among the
seigniors rendering a general insurrection impossible.
</p>

<p>
The Genoese party was specially strong on Cape Corso,
where the Signori da Mare were the most powerful family.
With their help, and that of the Caporali, who had degenerated
from popular tribunes to petty tyrants, and formed now
a new order of nobility, Genoa forced Vincentello to retire to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
his own seigniory of Cinarca. The brave Corsican partly
wrought his own fall: libertine as he was, he had carried off
a young girl from Biguglia; her friends took up arms, and
delivered the place into the hands of Simon da Mare. The
unfortunate Vincentello now resolved to have recourse once
more to the House of Arragon; but Zacharias Spinola captured
the galley which was conveying him to Sicily, and
brought the dreaded enemy of Genoa a prisoner to the Senate.
Vincentello d'Istria was beheaded on the great stairs of the
Palace of Genoa. This was in the year 1434. "He was a
glorious man," remarks the old Corsican chronicler.

THE BANK OF ST. GEORGE OF GENOA.
</h3>

<p>
After the death of Vincentello, the seigniors contended
with each other for the title of Count of Corsica; Simon da
Mare, Giudice d'Istria, Renuccio da Leca, Paolo della Rocca,
were the chief competitors; now one, now another, assuming
the designation. In Genoa, the Fregosi and Adorni had split
the Republic into two factions; and both families were endeavouring
to secure the possession of Corsica. This occasioned
new wars and new miseries. No respite, no year of
jubilee, ever came for this unhappy country. The entire
population was constantly in arms, attacking or defending.
The island was revolt, war, conflagration, blood, from one
end to the other.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1443, some of the Corsicans offered the supremacy
to Pope Eugene IV., in the hope that the Church might
perhaps be able to restrain faction, and restore peace. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
Pope sent his plenipotentiary with troops; but this only increased
the embroilment. The people assembled themselves
to a diet in Morosaglia, and chose a brave and able man,
Mariano da Gaggio, as their Lieutenant-general. Mariano
first directed his efforts successfully against the degenerate
Caporali, expelled them from their castles, destroyed many of
these, and declared their office abolished. The Caporali, on
their side, called the Genoese Adorno into the island. The
people now placed themselves anew under the protection of the
Pope; and as the Fregosi had meanwhile gained the upper
hand in Genoa, and Nicholas V., a Genoese Pope, favoured
them, he put the government of Corsica into the hands of
Ludovico Campo Fregoso in the year 1449. In vain the people
rose in insurrection under Mariano. To increase the already
boundless confusion, Jacob Imbisora, an Arragonese viceroy,
appeared, demanding subjection in the name of Arragon.
</p>

<p>
The despairing people assembled again to a diet at Lago
Benedetto, and adopted the fatal resolution of placing themselves
under the Bank of St. George of Genoa. This society
had been founded in the year 1346 by a company of capitalists,
who lent the Republic money, and farmed certain portions of
the public revenue as guarantee for its repayment. At the
request of the Corsicans, the Genoese Republic ceded the island
to this Bank, and the Fregosi renounced their claims, receiving
a sum of money in compensation.
</p>

<p>
The Company of St. George, under the supremacy of the
Senate, entered upon the territory thus acquired in the year
1453, as upon an estate from which they were to draw the
highest returns possible.
</p>

<p>
But years elapsed before the Bank succeeded in establishing
its authority in the island. The seigniors beyond the mountains,
in league with Arragon, made a desperate resistance.
The governors of the Bank acted with reckless severity;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>[32]</a></span>
many heads fell; various nobles went into exile, and collected
around Tomasin Fregoso, a man of a restless disposition,
whose remembrance of his family's claims upon Corsica had
been greatly quickened, since his uncle Lodovico had become
Doge. He came, accompanied by the exiles, routed the forces
of the Bank, and put himself in possession of a large portion of
the island, after the people had proclaimed him Count.
</p>

<p>
In 1464, Genoa fell into the hands of Francesco Sforza of
Milan, and a power with which Corsica had never had anything
to do, began to look upon the island as its own. The
Corsicans, who preferred all other masters to the Genoese,
gladly took the oath of allegiance to the Milanese general,
Antonio Cotta, at the diet of Biguglia. But on the same day
a slight quarrel again kindled the flames of war over all
Corsica. Some peasants of Nebbio had fallen out with certain
retainers of the seigniors from beyond the mountains, and
blood had been shed. The Milanese commandant forthwith
inflicted punishment on the guilty parties. The haughty
nobles, considering their seigniorial rights infringed on, immediately
mounted their horses and rode off to their homes
without saying a word. Preparations for war commenced.
To avert a new outbreak, the inhabitants of the Terra del
Commune held a diet, named Sambucuccio d'Alando&mdash;a descendant
of the first Corsican legislator&mdash;their vicegerent, and
empowered him to use every possible means to establish peace.
Sambucuccio's dictatorship dismayed the insurgents; they submitted
to him and remained quiet. A second diet despatched
him and others as ambassadors to Milan, to lay the state of
matters before the Duke, and request the withdrawal of Cotta.
</p>

<p>
Cotta was replaced by the certainly less judicious Amelia,
who occasioned a war that lasted for years. In all these
troubles the democratic Terra del Commune appears as an
island in the island, surrounded by the seigniories; it remains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
always united, and true to itself, and represents, it may be
said, the Corsican people. For almost two hundred years we
have seen nothing decisive happen without a popular Diet
(<i>veduta</i>), and we have several times remarked that the people
themselves have elected their counts or vicegerents.
</p>

<p>
The war between the Corsicans and the Milanese was still
raging with great fury when Thomas Campo Fregoso again
appeared upon the island, trying his fortunes there once more.
The Milanese sent him to Milan a prisoner. Singular to relate,
he returned from that city in the year 1480, furnished
with documents entitling him to have his claims acknowledged.
His government, and that of his son Janus, were so
cruel, that it was impossible the rule of the Fregoso family
could last long, though they had connected themselves by
marriage with one of the most influential men in the island,
Giampolo da Leca.
</p>

<p>
The people, meanwhile, chose Renuccio da Leca as their
leader, who immediately addressed himself to the Prince of
Piombino, Appian IV., and offered to place Corsica under his
protection, provided he sent sufficient troops to clear the island
of all tyrants. How unhappy the condition of this poor people
must have been, seeking help thus on every side, beseeching
the aid now of one powerful despot, now of another, adding
by foreign tyrants to the number of its own! The Prince of
Piombino thought proper to see what could be done in Corsica,
more especially as part of Elba already belonged to him. He
sent his brother Gherardo di Montagnara with a small army.
Gherardo was young, handsome, of attractive manners, and he
lived in a style of theatrical splendour. He came sumptuously
dressed, followed by a magnificent retinue, with beautiful
horses and dogs, with musicians and jugglers. It seemed
as if he were going to conquer the island to music. The
Corsicans, who had scarcely bread to eat, gazed on him in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>[34]</a></span>
astonishment, as if he were some supernatural visitant, conducted
him to their popular assembly at the Lago Benedetto,
and amid great rejoicings, proclaimed him Count of Corsica,
in the year 1483. The Fregosi lost courage, and, despairing
of their sinking cause, sold their claim to the Genoese
Bank for 2000 gold scudi. The Bank now made vigorous
preparations for war with Gherardo and Renuccio. Renuccio
lost a battle. This frightened the young Prince of Piombino
to such a degree, that he quitted the island with all the haste
possible, somewhat less theatrically than he had come to it.
Piombino desisted from all further attempts.

PATRIOTIC STRUGGLES&mdash;GIAMPOLO DA LECA&mdash;RENUCCIO DELLA ROCCA.
</h3>

<p>
Two bold men now again rise in succession to oppose
Genoa. Giampolo da Leca had, as we have seen, become
connected with the Fregosi. Although these nobles had resigned
their title in favour of the Bank, they were exceedingly
uneasy under the loss of influence they had sustained. Janus,
accordingly, without leaving Genoa, incited his relative to
revolt against the governor, Matias Fiesco. Giampolo rose.
But beaten and hard pressed by the troops of the Bank, he
saw himself compelled, after a vain attempt to obtain aid from
Florence, to lay down his arms, and to emigrate to Sardinia
with wife, child, and friends, in the year 1487.
</p>

<p>
A year had scarcely passed, when he again appeared at the
call of his adherents. A second time unfortunate, he made
his escape again to Sardinia. The Genoese now punished the
rebels with the greatest severity&mdash;with death, banishment,
and the confiscation of their property. More and more fierce
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
grew the Corsican hatred towards Genoa. For ten years they
nursed its smouldering glow. All this while Giampolo remained
in exile, meditating revenge&mdash;his watchful eye never
lifted from his oppressed and prostrate country. At last he
came back. He had neither money nor arms; four Corsicans
and six Spaniards were all his troops, and with these he landed.
He was beloved by the people, for he was noble, brave,
and of great personal beauty. The Corsicans crowded to him
from Cinarca, from Vico, from Niolo, and from Morosaglia.
He was soon at the head of a body of seven thousand foot and
two hundred horse&mdash;a force which made the Bank of Genoa
tremble for its power. It accordingly despatched to the island
Ambrosio Negri, an experienced general. Negri, by intrigue
and fair promises, contrived to detach a part of Giampolo's
followers, and particularly to draw over to himself Renuccio
della Rocca, a nobleman of activity and spirit. Giampolo,
with forces sensibly diminished, came to an engagement with
the Genoese commander at the Foce al Sorbo, and suffered a
defeat, in which his son Orlando was taken prisoner. He concluded
a treaty with Negri, the terms of which allowed him
to leave the island unmolested. He returned to Sardinia in
1501, with fifty Corsicans, there to waste his life in inconsolable
grief.
</p>

<p>
Giampolo's fall was mainly owing to Renuccio della Rocca.
This man, the head of the haughty family of Cinarca, saw
that the Genoese Bank had adopted a particular line of policy,
and was pursuing it with perseverance; he saw that it was
resolved to crush completely and for ever the power of the
seigniors, more especially of those whose lands lay beyond the
mountains, and that his own turn would come. Convinced of
this, he suddenly rose in arms in the year 1502. The contest
was short, and the issue favourable for Genoa, whose governor
in the island was at that time one of the Doria family. All
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
the Dorias, as governors, distinguished themselves by their
energy and by their reckless cruelty, and it was to them alone
that Genoa owed her gratitude for the important service of at
length crushing the Corsican nobility. Nicolas Doria forced
Renuccio to come to terms; and one of the conditions imposed
on the Corsican noble was that he and his family were henceforth
to reside in Genoa.
</p>

<p>
Giampolo was, still living in Sardinia, more than all other
Corsican patriots a source of continual anxiety to the Genoese,
who made several attempts to come to an amicable agreement
with him. His son Orlando, who had newly escaped to Rome
from his prison in Genoa, sent pressing solicitations from that
city to his father to rouse himself from his dumb and prostrate
inactivity. But Giampolo continued to maintain his heartbroken
silence, and listened as little to the suggestions of his
son as to those of the Genoese.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Renuccio disappeared from Genoa in the year
1504; he left wife and child in the hands of his enemies, and
went secretly to Sardinia to seek an interview with the man
whom he had plunged into misfortune. Giampolo refused to
see him. He was equally deaf to the entreaties of the Corsicans,
who all eagerly awaited his arrival. His own relations
had in the meantime murdered his son. The viceroy caught
the murderers, and was about to execute them, in order to show
a favour to Giampolo. But the generous man forgave them,
and begged their liberation.
</p>

<p>
Renuccio had meanwhile gathered eighteen resolute men
about him, and, undeterred by the fate of his children, who
had been thrown into a dungeon immediately after his flight,
he landed again in Corsica. Nicolas Doria, however, lost no
time in attacking him before the insurrection became formidable,
and he gained a victory. To daunt Renuccio, he had
his eldest son beheaded, and he threatened the youngest with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
a like fate, but allowed himself to be moved by the boy's entreaties
and tears. The unhappy father, defeated at every
point, fled to Sardinia, and then to Arragon. Doria took
ample revenge on all who had shown him countenance, laid
whole districts of the island waste, burned the villages, and
dispersed the inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
Renuccio della Rocca returned in the year 1507. This
unyielding man was entirely the reverse of the moody and
sorrow-laden Giampolo. He set foot on his native soil with
only twenty companions. Another of the Dorias met him
this time, Andreas, afterwards the famous Doge, who had
served under his cousin Nicolò. The Corsican historian
Filippini, a Genoese partisan, admits the cruelties committed
by Andreas during this short campaign. He succeeded in
speedily crushing the revolt; and compelled Renuccio a
second time to accept a safe conduct to Genoa. When the
Corsican arrived, the people would have torn him to pieces,
had not the French governor carried him off with all speed
to his castle.
</p>

<p>
Three years elapsed. Suddenly Renuccio again showed
himself in Corsica. He had escaped from Genoa, and after
in vain imploring the aid of the European princes, once more
bidding defiance to fortune, he had landed in his native
country with eight friends. Some of his former vassals received
him in Freto, weeping, deeply moved by the accumulated
misfortunes of the man, and his unexampled intrepidity
of soul. He spoke to them, and conjured them once
more to draw the sword. They were silent, and went away.
He remained some days in Freto, in concealment. Nicolo
Pinello, a captain of Genoese troops in Ajaccio, accidentally
passed by upon his horse. The sight of him proved so intolerable
to Renuccio, that he attacked him at night and killed
him, took his horse, and now showed himself in public. As
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
soon us his presence in the island became known, the soldiers
of Ajaccio were sent out to capture him. Renuccio fled into
the hills, hunted like a bandit or wild beast. The peasantry,
who were put to the torture by his pursuers, as a means of
inducing them to discover his lurking-places, at last resolved
to end their own miseries and his life. In the month of May
1511, Renuccio della Rocca was found miserably slain in the
hills. He was one of the stoutest hearts of the noble house
of Cinarca. "They tell," says the Corsican chronicler, "that
Renuccio was true to himself till the last, and that he showed
no less heroism in his death than in his life; and this is, of a
truth, much to his honour, for a brave man should never lose
his nobleness of soul, even when fate brings him to an ignominious
end."
</p>

<p>
Giampolo had meanwhile gone to Rome, to ask the aid of
the Pope, but, unsuccessful in his exertions, he died there in
the year 1515.

STATE OF CORSICA UNDER THE BANK OF ST. GEORGE.
</h3>

<p>
With Giampolo and Renuccio ended the resistance of the
Corsican seigniors. The noble families of the island decayed,
their strong keeps fell into ruin, and at present we hardly distinguish
here and there upon the rocks of Corsica the blackened
walls of the castles of Cinarca, Istria, Leca, and Ornano.
But Genoa, in crushing one dreaded foe, had raised against
herself another far more formidable&mdash;the Corsican people.
</p>

<p>
During this era of the iron rule of the Genoese Bank, many
able men emigrated, and sought for themselves name and fame
in foreign countries. They entered into military service, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
became famous as generals and Condottieri. Some were in
the service of the Medici, others in that of the Spozzi; or
they were among the Venetians, in Rome, with the Gonzagas,
or with the French. Filippini names a long array of them;
among the rest, Guglielmo of Casabianca, Baptista of Leca,
Bartelemy of Vivario, with the surname of Telamon, Gasparini,
Ceccaldi, and Sampiero of Bastelica. Fortune was
especially kind to a Corsican of Bastia, named Arsano; turning
renegade, he raised himself to be King of Algiers, under
the appellation of Lazzaro. This is the more singular, that
precisely at this time Corsica was suffering dreadfully from
the Moors, and the Bank had surrounded the whole island
with a girdle of beacons and watch-towers, and fortified Porto
Vecchio on the southern coast.
</p>

<p>
After the wars with Giampolo and Renuccio, the government
of the Bank was at first mild and paternal, and Corsica
enjoyed the blessings of order and peace. So says the Corsican
chronicler.
</p>

<p>
The administration of public affairs, on which very slight
alteration was made after the Republic took it out of the hands
of the Bank, was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The Bank sent a governor to Corsica yearly, who resided
in Bastia. He brought with him a vicario, or vicegerent,
and a doctor of laws. The entire executive was in his hands;
he was the highest judicial and military authority. He had
his lieutenants (<span lang='it_IT'><i>luogotenenti</i></span>) in Calvi, Algajola, San Fiorenzo,
Ajaccio, Bonifazio, Sartena, Vico, Cervione, and Corte.
An appeal lay from them to the governor. All these officials
were changed once a year, or once in two years. To protect
the people from an oppressive exercise of power on their part,
a Syndicate had been established, before which a complaint
against any particular magistrate could be lodged. If the
complaint was found to be well grounded, the procedure of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
the magistrate concerned could be reversed, and he himself
punished with removal from his office. The governor himself
was responsible to the Syndics. They were six in number&mdash;three
from the people, and three from the aristocracy; and
might be either Corsicans or Genoese. In particular cases,
commissaries came over, charged with the duty of instituting
inquiries.
</p>

<p>
Besides all this, the people exercised the important right
of naming the Dodici, or Council of Twelve; and they did
this each time a change took place in the highest magistracy.
Strictly speaking, twelve were chosen for the districts this
side the mountains, six for those beyond. The Dodici represented
the people's voice in the deliberations of the governor;
and without their consent no law could be enacted, abolished,
or modified. One of their number went to Genoa, with the
title of Oratore, to act as representative of the Corsican people
in the Senate there.
</p>

<p>
The democratic basis of the constitution of the communes
and <span lang='it_IT'><i>pievi</i></span>, with their Fathers of the Community and their
<span lang='it_IT'><i>podestàs</i></span>, was not altered, and the popular assembly (<span lang='it_IT'><i>veduta</i></span>
or <span lang='it_IT'><i>consulta</i></span>) was still permitted. The governor usually summoned
it in Biguglia, when anything of general importance
was to be done with the consent of the people.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that these arrangements were of a democratic
nature&mdash;that they allowed the people free political movement,
and a share in the government; gave them a hold on the protection
of the law, and checked the arbitrary tendencies of
officials. The Corsican people was, therefore, well entitled
to congratulate itself, and consider itself favoured far beyond
the other nations of Europe, if such laws were really allowed
their due force, and did not become an empty show. How
they did become an empty show, and how the Genoese rule
passed into an abominable despotism&mdash;Genoa, like Venice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
committing the fatal error of alienating her foreign provinces
by a tyrannous, instead of attaching them to herself by a
benevolent treatment&mdash;we shall see in the following chapters.
For now Corsica brings forward her bravest man, and one of
the most remarkable characters of the century, against Genoa.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p2" />

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br />
<br />

THE PATRIOT SAMPIERO.
</h3>

<p>
Sampiero was born in Bastelica, a spot lying above Ajaccio,
in one of the wildest regions of the Corsican mountains, not
of an ancient family, but of unknown parents. Guglielmo,
grandson of Vinciguerra, has been named as his father; others
say he was of the family of the Porri.
</p>

<p>
Like other Corsican youths, Sampiero had betaken himself
to the Continent, and foreign service, at an early age. We
find him in the service of the Cardinal Hippolyto de Medici,
among the Black Bands at Florence; and he was still young
when the world was already talking of his bold deeds, noble
disposition, and great force of character. He was the sword
and shield of the Medici in their struggle with the Pazzi.
Thirsting for action and a wider field, he left his position of
Condottiere with these princes, and entered the army of Francis
I. of France. The king made him colonel of a Corsican
regiment which he had formed. Bayard became his friend,
and Charles of Bourbon honoured his impetuous bravery and
military skill. "On a day of battle," said Bourbon, "the
Corsican colonel is worth ten thousand men." Sampiero distinguished
himself on many fields and before many fortresses,
and his reputation was equally great with friend and foe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Entirely devoted to the interests of his master, who was
now prosecuting the war with Spain, he had still ear and eye
for his native island, from which voices reached him now and
then that moved him deeply. He came to Corsica in the
year 1547, to take a wife from among his own countrywomen.
He chose a daughter of one of the oldest houses beyond the
mountains&mdash;the house of Ornano. Though he was himself
without ancestry, Sampiero's fame and well-known manly
worth were a patent of nobility which Francesco Ornano could
not despise; and he gave him the hand of his only daughter,
the beautiful Vannina, the heiress of Ornano.
</p>

<p>
No sooner did the governor of the Genoese Bank learn the
presence of Sampiero&mdash;in whom he foreboded an implacable
foe&mdash;within the bounds of his authority, than, in defiance of
all justice, he had him seized and thrown into prison. Francesco
Ornano, fearing for his son-in-law's life, hastened to
Genoa to the French ambassador. The latter instantly demanded
Sampiero's liberation. The demand was complied
with; but the insult done him was now for Sampiero another
and a personal spur to give relief in action to his long-cherished
hatred of Genoa, and ardent wish to free his native country.
</p>

<p>
The posture of continental affairs, the war between France
and Charles V., soon gave him opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Henry II., husband of Catherine de Medici, deeply involved
in Italian politics, in active war with the Emperor, and in
alliance with the Turks, who were on the point of sending a
fleet into the Western Mediterranean, agreed to the proposal
of an enterprise against Corsica. A double end seemed attainable
by this: for first, in threatening Corsica, Genoa was
menaced; and secondly, as the Republic, since Andreas Doria
had freed her from the French yoke, had become the close
ally of Charles V., carrying the war into Corsica was carrying
it on against the Emperor himself. And besides, the island
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
offered an excellent position in the Mediterranean, and a basis
for the operations of the combined French and Turkish fleets.
Marshal Thermes, therefore, at that time in Italy, and besieging
Siena, received orders to prepare for the conquest of
Corsica.
</p>

<p>
He held a council of war in Castiglione. Sampiero was
overjoyed at the turn affairs had taken; all his wishes were
centred in the liberation of his country. He represented to
Thermes the necessary and important consequences of the
undertaking, and it was forthwith set on foot. Its success
could not be doubted. The French only needed to land, and
the Corsican people would that moment rise in arms. The
hatred of the rule of the Genoese merchants had reached,
since the fall of Renuccio, the utmost pitch of intensity; and
it had its ground not merely in the ineradicable passion of the
people for liberty, but in the actual state of affairs in the
island. For, as soon as the Bank saw its power secured, it
began to rule despotically. The Corsicans had been stripped
of all their political rights: they had lost their Syndicate, the
Dodici, their old communal magistracies; justice was venal,
murder permitted&mdash;at least the murderer was protected in
Genoa, and furnished with letters-patent for his personal
safety. The horrors of the Vendetta, therefore, of the implacable
revenge that insists on blood for blood, took root firm
and fast. All writers on Corsican history are unanimous,
that the demoralization of the courts of justice was the deepest
wound which the Bank of Genoa inflicted on Corsica.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero had sent a Corsican, named Altobello de Gentili,
into the island, to ascertain the state of the popular feeling;
his letters, and the hope of his coming kindled the wildest
joy; the people trembled with eagerness for the arrival of the
fleet. Thermes, and Admiral Paulin, whose squadron had
effected a junction with the Turkish fleet at Elba, now sailed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
for Corsica in August 1553. The brave Pietro Strozzi and
his company was with them, though not long; Sampiero, the
hope of the Corsicans, was with them; Johann Ornano, Rafael
Gentili, Altobello, and other exiles, all burning for revenge,
and impatient to drench their swords in Genoese blood.
</p>

<p>
They landed on the Renella near Bastia. Scarcely had
Sampiero shown himself on the city walls, which the invaders
ascended by means of scaling ladders, when the people threw
open the gates. Bastia surrendered. Without delay they
proceeded to reduce the other strong towns, and the interior.
Paulin anchored before Calvi, the Turk Dragut before Bonifazio,
Thermes marched on San Fiorenzo, Sampiero on Corte,
the most important of the inland fortresses. Here too he had
no sooner shown himself than the gates were opened. The
Genoese fled in every direction, the cause of liberty was triumphant
throughout the island; only Ajaccio, Bonifazio, and
Calvi, trusting to the natural strength of their situation, still
held out. Neither Paulin from the sea, nor Sampiero from
the land, could make any impression on Calvi. The siege
was raised, and Sampiero hastened to Ajaccio. The Genoese
under Lamba Doria prepared for an obstinate defence, but
the people opened the gates to their deliverer. The houses
of the Genoese were plundered; yet, even here, in the case
of their country's enemies, the Corsicans showed how sacred
in their eyes were the natural laws of generosity and hospitality;
many Genoese, fleeing to the villages for an asylum,
found shelter with their foes. Francesco Ornano took Lamba
Doria into his own house.

SAMPIERO&mdash;FRANCE AND CORSICA.
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile the Turk was besieging Bonifazio with furious
vigour, ravaging at the same time the entire surrounding
country. Dragut was provoked by the heroic resistance of
the inhabitants, who showed themselves worthy descendants
of those earlier Bonifazians that so bravely held the town
against Alfonso of Arragon. Night and day, despite of hunger
and weariness, they manned the walls, successfully repelling
all attacks, the women showing equal courage with the men.
Sampiero came to the assistance of the Turks; the assaults of
the besiegers continued without intermission, but the town remained
steadfast. The Bonifazians were in hopes of relief,
hourly expecting Cattaciolo, one of their fellow-citizens, from
Genoa. The messenger came, bearing news of approaching
succours; but he fell into the hands of the French. They
made a traitor of him, inducing him to carry forged letters
into the city, which advised the commandant to give up all
hope of being relieved. He accordingly concluded a treaty,
and surrendered the unconquered town under the condition
that the garrison should be allowed to embark for Genoa with
military honours. The brave defenders had scarcely left the
protection of their walls, when the barbarous Turk, trampling
under foot at once his oath and common humanity, fell upon
them, and began to cut them in pieces. Sampiero with difficulty
rescued all that it was still possible to rescue. Not
content with this revenge, Dragut demanded to be allowed to
plunder the city, and, when this was refused, a large sum in
compensation, which Thermes could not pay, but promised to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
pay. Dragut, exasperated, instantly embarked, and set sail
for Asia&mdash;he had been corrupted by Genoese gold.
</p>

<p>
After the fall of Bonifazio, Genoa had not a foot of land left in
Corsica, except the "ever-faithful" Calvi. No time was to be
lost, therefore, if the island was not to be entirely relinquished.
The Emperor had promised help, and placed some thousands
of Germans and Spaniards at the disposal of the Genoese, and
Cosmo de Medici sent an auxiliary corps. A very considerable
force had thus been collected, and, to put success beyond
question, the leadership of the expedition was intrusted to
their most celebrated general, Andreas Doria, while Agostino
Spinola was made second in command.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Doria was at that time in his eighty-sixth year;
but the aspect of affairs seemed so critical, that the old man
could not but comply with the call of his fellow-citizens. He
received the banner of the enterprise in the Cathedral of
Genoa, from the senators, protectors of the Bank, the clergy,
and the people.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th November 1553, Doria landed in the Gulf
of San Fiorenzo, and, in a short time, the star of Genoa was
once more in the ascendant. San Fiorenzo, which had been
strongly fortified by Thermes, fell; Bastia surrendered; the
French gave way on every side. Sampiero had about this
time, in consequence of a quarrel with Thermes, been obliged
to proceed to the French court; but after putting his calumniators
there to silence, he returned in higher credit than
before, and as the alone heart and soul of the war, which the
incapable Thermes had proved himself unfit to conduct. He
was indefatigable in attack, in resistance, in guerilla warfare.
Spinola met with a sharp repulse on the field of Golo, but a
wound which Sampiero received in the fight rendering him
for some time inactive, the Corsicans suffered a bloody defeat
at Morosaglia. Sampiero now gave his wound no more time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'>[47]</a></span>
to heal; he again appeared on the field, and defeated the
Spaniards and Germans in the battle of Col di Tenda, in the
year 1554.
</p>

<p>
The war was carried on with unabated fury for five years.
Corsica seemed to be certain of the perpetual protection of
France, and in general to regard herself as an independently
organized section of that kingdom. Francis II. had named
Jourdan Orsini his viceroy, and the latter, at a general diet,
had, in the name of his king, pronounced Corsica incorporated
with France, declaring that it was now for all time impossible
to separate the island from the French crown&mdash;that the one
could be abandoned only with the other. The fate of Corsica
seemed, therefore, already linked to the French monarchy,
and the island to be detached from the general body of the
Italian states, to which it naturally belongs. But scarcely
had the king made the solemn announcement above referred
to, when the treaty of Cateau Cambresis, in the year 1559,
shattered at a single blow all the hopes of the Corsicans.
</p>

<p>
France concluded a peace with Philip of Spain and his
allies, and engaged to surrender Corsica to the Genoese. The
French, accordingly, immediately put all the places they had
garrisoned into the hands of Genoa, and embarked their troops.
A desperate struggle had been maintained for six years to no
purpose, diplomacy now lightly gamed away the earnings of
that long war's bloody toil, and the Corsican saw himself
hurled back into his old misery, and abandoned, defenceless,
to Genoese vengeance, by a rag of paper, a pen-and-ink
peace. This breach of faith was a crushing blow, and extorted
from the country a universal cry of despair, but it was
not listened to.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br />
<br />

SAMPIERO IN EXILE&mdash;HIS WIFE VANNINA.
</h3>

<p>
It was now that Sampiero began to show himself in all his
greatness; for the man must be admitted to be really great
whom adversity does not bend, but who gathers double
strength from misfortune. He had quitted Corsica as an
outlaw. The peace had taken the sword out of his hand;
the island, ravaged and desolate from end to end, could not
venture a new struggle on its own resources&mdash;a new war
needed fresh support from a foreign power. For four years
Sampiero wandered over Europe seeking help at its most
distant courts; he travelled to France to Catherine, hoping
to find her mindful of old services that he had done the house
of Medici; he went to Navarre; to the Duke of Florence; to
the Fregosi; to one Italian court after another; he sailed to
Algiers to Barbarossa; he hastened to Constantinople to the
Sultan Soliman. His stern, imposing demeanour, the emphatic
sincerity of his speech, his powerful intellect, his glowing
patriotism, everywhere commanded admiration and respect,
among the barbarians not less than among the Christians;
but they comforted him with vain hopes and empty promises.
</p>

<p>
While Sampiero was thus wandering with unwearied perseverance
from court to court, inciting the princes to an enterprise
in behalf of Corsica, Genoa had not lost sight of
him; Genoa was alarmed to think what might one day be the
result of his exertions. It was clearly necessary, by some
means or other, to cripple once for all the dreaded arm of
Sampiero. Poison and assassination, it is said, had been tried,
but had failed. It was resolved to crush his spirit, by bringing
his natural affection as a father and a husband into conflict
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
with his passionate love of country. It was resolved to
break his heart.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero's wife Vannina lived in her own house at Marseilles,
under the protection of France. She had her youngest
son, Francesco, beside her; the elder, Alfonso, was at the
court of Catherine. The Genoese surrounded her with their
agents and spies. It was their aim, and it was important to
them, to allure Sampiero's wife and child to Genoa. To
effect this, they employed a certain Michael Angelo Ombrone,
who had been tutor to the young sons of Sampiero, and enjoyed
his entire confidence; a cunning villain of the name of
Agosto Bazzicaluga was another of their tools. Vannina was
of a susceptible and credulous nature, proud of the ancient
name of Ornano. These Genoese traitors represented to her
the fate that necessarily awaited the children of her proscribed
husband. Heirs of their father's outlawry, robbed of the
seigniory of their renowned ancestors, poor&mdash;their very lives
not safe, what might they not come to? They pictured to
her alarmed imagination these, her beloved children, in the
wretchedness of exile, eating the bread of dependence, or what
was worse, if they trod in the footsteps of their father, hunted
in the mountains, at last captured, and loaded with the chains
of galley-slaves.
</p>

<p>
Vannina was deeply moved&mdash;her fidelity began to waver;
the thought of going to Genoa grew gradually less foreign to
her&mdash;less and less repulsive. There, said Ombrone and Bazzicaluga,
they will restore to your children the seigniory of
Ornano, and your own gentle persuasions will at length succeed
in reconciling even Sampiero with the Republic. The
poor mother's heart was not proof against this. Vannina was
thoroughly a woman; her natural feeling at last spoke with
imperious decision, refusing to comprehend or sympathize with
the grand, rugged, terrible character of her husband, who only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
lived because he loved his country, and hated its oppressors;
and who nourished with his own being the all-consuming fire
of his sole passion&mdash;remorselessly flinging in all his other possessions
like faggots to feed the flames. Her blinded heart
extorted from Vannina the resolution to go to Genoa. One
day, she said to herself, we shall all be happy, peaceful, and
reconciled.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero was in Algiers, where the bold renegade Barbarossa,
as Sultan of the country, had received him with signal
marks of respect, when a ship arrived from Marseilles, and
brought the tidings that his wife was on the point of escaping
to Genoa with his boy. When Sampiero began to comprehend
the possibility of this flight, his first thought was to
throw himself instantly into the vessel, and hasten to Marseilles;
he became calmer, and bade his noble friend, Antonio
of San Fiorenzo, go instead, and prevent the escape&mdash;if prevention
were still possible. He himself, restraining his sorrow
within his innermost heart, remained, negotiated with Barbarossa
about an expedition against Genoa, and subsequently
sailed for Constantinople, to try what could be effected with
the Sultan, not till then proposing to return to Marseilles to
ascertain the position of his private affairs.
</p>

<p>
Antonio of San Fiorenzo had made all possible haste upon
his mission. Rushing into Vannina's house, he found it empty
and silent. She was away with her child, and Ombrone, and
Bazzicaluga, in a Genoese ship, secretly, the day before.
Hurriedly Antonio collected friends, Corsicans, armed men,
threw himself into a brigantine, and made all sail in the direction
which the fugitives ought to have taken. He sighted the
Genoese vessel off Antibes, and signalled for her to shorten sail.
When Vannina saw that she was pursued, knowing too well
who her pursuers were likely to be, in an agony of terror she
begged to be put ashore, scarcely knowing what she did. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
Antonio reached her as she landed, and took possession of her
person in the name of Sampiero and the King of France.
</p>

<p>
He brought her to the house of the Bishop of Antibes, that
the lady, quite prostrate with grief, might enjoy the consolations
of religion, and might have a secure asylum in the dwelling
of a priest. Horrible thoughts, to which he gave no expression,
made this advisable. But the Bishop of Antibes
was afraid of the responsibility he might incur, and refusing
to run any risk, he gave Vannina into the hands of the Parliament
of Aix. The Parliament declared its readiness to take
her under its protection, and to permit none, whoever he
might be, to do her violence. But Vannina wished nothing
of all this, and declined the offer. She was, she said, Sampiero's
wife, and whatever sentence her husband might pronounce
on her, to that sentence she would submit. The guilty
consciousness of her fatal step lay heavy on her heart, and
while she wept bitterest tears of repentance, she imposed on
herself a noble and silent resignation to the consequences.
</p>

<p>
And now Sampiero, leaving the Turkish court, where Soliman
had for a while wonderingly entertained the famous
Corsican, returned to Marseilles, giving himself up to his own
personal anxieties. At Marseilles, he found Antonio, who
related to him what had occurred, and endeavoured to restrain
his friend's gathering wrath. One of Sampiero's relations,
Pier Giovanni of Calvi, let fall the imprudent remark that he
had long foreseen Vannina's flight. "And you concealed
what you foresaw?" cried Sampiero, and stabbed him dead
with a single thrust of his dagger. He threw himself on
horseback, and rode in furious haste to Aix, where his trembling
wife waited for him in the castle of Zaisi. Antonio
hurried after him, agonized with the fear that all efforts of
his to avert some dreadful catastrophe might be unavailing.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero waited beneath the windows of the castle till
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
morning. He then went to his wife, and took her away with
him to Marseilles. No one could read his silent purposings
in his stern face. As he entered his house with her, and saw
it standing desolate and empty, the whole significance of the
affront&mdash;the full consciousness of her treason and its possible
results, sank upon his heart; once more the intolerable thought
shot through him that it was his own wife who had basely
sold herself and his child into the detested hands of his
country's enemies; the demon of phrenzy took possession of
his soul, and he slew her with his own hand.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero, says the Corsican historian, loved his wife passionately,
but as a Corsican&mdash;that is, to the last Vendetta.
</p>

<p>
He buried his dead in the Church of St. Francis, and did
not spare funereal pomp. He then went to show himself at
the court of Paris. This occurred in the year 1562.
</p>

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER XVII.</span>

RETURN OF SAMPIERO&mdash;STEPHEN DORIA.
</h3>

<p>
Sampiero was coldly received at the French court; the
courtiers whispered, avoided him, sneered at him from behind
their virtuous mask. Sampiero was not the man to be dismayed
by courtiers, nor was the court of Catherine de Medici
a tribunal before which the fearful deed of one of the most
remarkable men of his time could be tried. Catherine and
Henry II. forgot that Sampiero had murdered his wife, but
they would do no more for Corsica than willingly look on
while it was freed by the exertions of others.
</p>

<p>
Now that he had done all that was possible as a diplomatist,
and saw no prospect of foreign aid, Sampiero fell back upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
himself, and resolved to trust to his own and his people's energies.
He accordingly wrote to his friends in Corsica that he
would come to free his country or die. "It lies with us now,"
he said, "to make a last effort to attain the happiness and
glory of complete freedom. We have applied to the cabinets
of France, of Navarre, and of Constantinople; but if we
do not take up arms till the day when the aid of France or
Tuscany shall be with us in the fight, there is a long period
of oppression yet in store for our country. And at any rate,
would a national independence obtained with the assistance of
foreigners be a prize worth contending for? Did the Greeks
seek help of their neighbours to rescue their independence from
the yoke of the Persians? The Italian Republics are recent
examples of what the strong will of a people can do, combined
with the love of country. Doria could free his native city
from the oppression of a tyrannous aristocracy; shall we forbear
to rise till the soldiers of the King of Navarre come to
fight in our ranks?"
</p>

<p>
On the 12th of June 1564, Sampiero landed in the Gulf of
Valinco, with a band of twenty Corsicans, and five-and-twenty
Frenchmen. He sank the galley which had brought him.
When he was asked why he had done so, and where he would
find refuge if the Genoese were now suddenly to attack him,
he answered, "In my sword!" He assaulted the castle of
Istria with this handful of men, took it, and marched rapidly
upon Corte. The Genoese drew out to meet him before the
walls of the town, with a much superior force, as Sampiero
had still not above a hundred men. But such was the terror
inspired by his mere name, that he no sooner appeared in
sight than they fled without drawing sword. Corte opened
its gates, and Sampiero had thus gained one important position.
The Terra del Commune immediately made common
cause with him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>[54]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sampiero now advanced on Vescovato, the richest district
of the island, on the slopes of the mountains where they sink
towards the beautiful plain of Mariana. The people of Vescovato
assembled at his approach, alarmed for the safety of
their harvest, which was threatened by this new storm of war.
They were urgently counselled by the Archdeacon Filippini,
the Corsican historian, to remain neutral, and take no notice
of Sampiero, whatever he might do. When Sampiero entered
Vescovato, he found it ominously quiet, and the people all
within their houses; at last, yielding to curiosity or sympathy,
they came out. Sampiero spoke to them, accusing
them, as he justly might, of a want of patriotism. His words
made a deep impression. Offers of entertainment in some of
their houses were made; but Sampiero punished the inhabitants
of Vescovato with his contempt, and passed the night
in the open air.
</p>

<p>
The place became nevertheless the scene of a bloody battle.
Nicolas Negri led his Genoese against it, as a position held
by Sampiero. It was a murderous struggle; the more so that
as the number engaged on both sides was comparatively small,
it was mainly a series of single combats. Corsicans, too, were
here fighting against Corsicans&mdash;for a company of the islanders
had remained in the service of Genoa. These fell back,
however, when Sampiero upbraided them for fighting against
their country. Victory was inclining to the side of Genoa&mdash;for
Bruschino, one of the bravest of the Corsican captains, had
fallen, when Sampiero, rallying his men for one last effort,
succeeded in finally repulsing the Genoese, who fled in disorder
towards Bastia.
</p>

<p>
The victory of Vescovato brought new additions to the
forces of Sampiero, and another at Caccia, in which Nicolas
Negri was among the killed, spread the insurrection through
the whole interior. Sampiero now hoped to be assisted in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
earnest by Tuscany, and even by the Turks; for in winning
battle after battle over the Spaniards and Genoese, with such
inconsiderable means at his command, he had shown what
Corsican patriotism might do if it were supported.
</p>

<p>
On the death of Negri, the Genoese without delay despatched
their best general to the island, in the person of Stephen
Doria, whose bravery, skill, and unscrupulous severity rendered
him worthy of the name. He was at the head of a
force of four thousand German and Italian mercenaries. The
war broke out, therefore, with fresh fury. The Corsicans
suffered some reverses; but the Genoese, weakened by important
defeats, were once more thrown back upon Bastia.
Doria had made an attack on Bastelica, Sampiero's birthplace,
had laid it in ashes, and made the patriot's house level
with the ground. Houses and property were little to the
man whose own hand had sacrificed his wife to his country;
noticeable, however, is this Genoese policy of constantly bringing
the patriotism of the Corsicans into tragic conflict with
their personal affections. What they tried in vain with Sampiero,
succeeded with Campocasso&mdash;a man of unusual heroism,
of an influential family of old Caporali. His mother had
been seized and placed in confinement. Her son did not
hesitate a moment&mdash;he threw away his sword, and hastened
into the Genoese camp to save his mother from the torture.
He left it again when they proposed to him to become the
murderer of Sampiero, and remained quiet at home. Powerful
friends were becoming fewer and fewer round Sampiero;
now that Bruschino had fallen, Campocasso gone over to the
enemy, and the brave Napoleon of Santa Lucia, the first of
his name who distinguished himself as a military leader, had
suffered a severe defeat.
</p>

<p>
If the whole hatred of the Corsicans and Genoese could be
put into two words, these two are Sampiero and Doria. Both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
names, suggestive of the deadliest personal feud, at the
same time completely represent their respective nationalities.
Stephen Doria exceeded all his predecessors in cruelty. He
had sworn to annihilate the Corsican people. His openly
expressed opinions are these:&mdash;"When the Athenians became
masters of the principal town in Melos, after it had
held out for seven months, they put all the inhabitants above
fourteen years of age to death, and sent a colony to people
the place anew, and keep it in obedience. Why do we not
imitate this example? Is it because the Corsicans deserve
punishment less than those ancient rebels? The Athenians
saw in these terrible chastisements the means of conquering
the Peloponnese, the whole of Greece, Africa, and Sicily. By
putting all their enemies to the sword, they restored the reputation
and terror of their arms. It will be said that this
procedure is contrary to the law of nations, to humanity, to
the progress of civilisation. What does it matter, provided
we only make ourselves feared?&mdash;that is all I ask. I care
more for what Genoa says than for the judgment of posterity,
which has no terrors for me. This empty word posterity
checks none but the weak and irresolute. Our interest is to
extend on every side the circle of conquered country, and to
take from the insurgents everything that can support a war.
Now, I see but two ways of doing this&mdash;first, by destroying
the crops, and secondly, by burning the villages, and pulling
down the towers in which they fortify themselves when they
dare not venture into the field."
</p>

<p>
The advice of Doria sufficiently shows how fierce the
Genoese hatred of this indomitable people had become, and
indicates but too plainly the unspeakable miseries the Corsicans
had to endure. Stephen Doria laid half the island
desolate with fire and sword; and Sampiero was still unconquered.
The Corsican patriot had held an assembly of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
people in Bozio to strengthen the general cause by the adoption
of suitable measures, to regulate anew the council of the
Dodici and the other popular magistracies, and to organize,
if possible, an insurrection of the entire people. Sampiero
was not a mere soldier, he was a far-seeing statesman. He
wished to give his country, with its independence, a free
republican constitution, founded on the ancient enactments
of Sambucuccio of Alando. He wished to draw, from the
situation of the island, from its forests and its products in
general, such advantages as might enable it to become a
naval power; he wished to make Corsica, in alliance with
France, powerful and formidable, as Rhodes and Tyre had
once been. Sampiero did not aim at the title of Count of
Corsica; he was the first who was called Father of his country.
The times of the seigniors were past.
</p>

<p>
He sent messengers to the continental courts, particularly
to France, asking assistance; but the Corsicans were left to
their fate. Antonio Padovano returned from France empty-handed;
he only brought Sampiero's young son Alfonso,
ten thousand dollars in money, and thirteen standards with
the inscription&mdash;<span lang='la'><i>Pugna pro patria</i></span>. This was, nevertheless,
enough to raise the spirits of the Corsicans; and the standards,
which Sampiero divided among the captains, became
the occasion of envy and dangerous heartburnings.
</p>

<p>
Here are two letters of Sampiero's.
</p>

<p>
To Catherine of France.&mdash;"Our affairs have hitherto been
prosperous. I can assure your Majesty, that unless the enemy
had received both secret and open help from the Catholic
King of Spain, at first twenty-two galleys and four ships, with
a great number of Spaniards, we should have reduced them
to such extremity, that by this time they would have been
no longer able to maintain a footing in the island. Nevertheless,
and come what will, we will never abandon the resolution
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
we have taken, to die sooner than acknowledge in any
way whatever the supremacy of the Republic. I pray of your
Majesty, therefore, in these circumstances, not to forget my
devotion to your person, and that of my country to France.
If his Catholic Majesty shows himself so friendly to the
Genoese, who are, even without him, so formidable to us&mdash;a
people forsaken by all the world&mdash;will your Majesty suffer us
to be destroyed by our cruel foes?"
</p>

<p>
To the Duke of Parma.&mdash;"Although we should become
tributary to the Ottoman Porte, and thus run the risk of
offending all the Princes of Christendom, nevertheless this
is our unalterable resolution&mdash;A hundred times rather the
Turks than the supremacy of the Republic. France herself
has not respected the treaty, which, as they said, was to be
the guarantee of our rights and the end of our miseries. If
I take the liberty of troubling you with the affairs of the
island, it is that your Highness may, if need be, take our
part at the court of Rome against the attacks of our enemies.
I desire that my words may at least remain a solemn protest
against the indifference of the Catholic Princes, and an appeal
to the Divine justice."

THE DEATH OF SAMPIERO.

Once more ambassadors set out for France, five in number;
but the Genoese intercepted them off the coast. Three leapt
into the sea to save themselves by swimming, one of whom
was drowned; the two who were captured were first put to
the torture, and then executed. The war assumed the frightful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
character of a merciless Vendetta on both sides. Doria,
however, effected nothing. Sampiero defeated him again and
again; and at last, in the passes of Luminanda, almost annihilated
the Genoese forces. It required the utmost exertion
of Doria's great skill and personal bravery to extricate himself
on the latter occasion. He arrived in San Fiorenzo,
bleeding, exhausted, and in despair, and soon after left the
island. The Republic replaced him by Vivaldi, and afterwards
by the artful and intriguing Fornari; but the Genoese
had lost all hope of crushing Sampiero by war and open force.
Against this man, who had come to the island as an outlaw
with a few outlawed followers, they had gradually sent their
whole force into the field&mdash;their own and a Spanish fleet, their
mercenaries, Germans, fifteen thousand Spaniards, their greatest
generals, Doria, Centurione, and Spinola; yet, the same
Genoa that had conquered Pisa and Venice had proved unable
to subdue a poor people, forsaken by the whole world, who
came into the ranks of battle starving, in rags, unshod, badly
armed, and who, when they returned home, found nothing
but the ashes of their villages.
</p>

<p>
It was therefore decided that Sampiero must be murdered.
</p>

<p>
Dissensions, fomented by the Genoese, had long existed
between him and the descendants of the old seigniors. Some,
like Hercules of Istria, had deserted him from lust of Genoese
gold, or because their pride revolted at the thought of obeying
a man who had risen from the dust. Others had a
Vendetta with Sampiero; they had a debt of blood to exact
from him. These were the nobles of the Ornano family,
three brothers&mdash;Antonio, Francesco, and Michael Angelo,
cousins of Vannina. Genoa had won them with gold, and the
promise of the seigniory of Ornano, of which Vannina's children
were the rightful heirs. The Ornanos, again, gained the
monk Ambrosius of Bastelica, and Sampiero's own servant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
Vittolo, a trusted follower, with whose help it was agreed to
take Sampiero in an ambuscade. The governor, Fornari,
approved of the plan, and committed its execution to Rafael
Giustiniani.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero was in Vico when the monk brought him forged
letters, urgently requesting him to come to Rocca, where a
rebellion, it was said, had broken out against the popular
cause. Sampiero instantly despatched Vittolo with twenty
horse to Cavro, and himself followed soon after. He was
accompanied by his son Alfonso, Andrea de' Gentili, Antonio
Pietro of Corte, and Battista da Pietra. Vittolo, in the meantime,
instructed the brothers Ornano, and Giustiniani, that
Sampiero would pass through the defile of Cavro; on receiving
which intelligence, they immediately set out for the spot
indicated with a considerable force of foot and horse, and
formed the ambuscade. Sampiero and his little band were
riding unsuspectingly through the pass, when they suddenly
found themselves assailed on every side, and the defile swarming
with armed men. He saw that his hour was come.
Yielding now to those impulses of natural affection which he
had once so signally disowned, he ordered his son Alfonso to
leave him, to flee, and save himself for his country. The son
obeyed, and escaped. Most of his friends had fallen bravely
fighting by his side, when Sampiero rushed into the <i>mêlée</i>, to
hew his way through if it were possible. The day was just
dawning. The three Ornanos had kept their eyes constantly
upon him, at first afraid to assail the terrible man; but at
length, spurred on by revenge, they pressed in upon him,
some Genoese soldiery at their back. Sampiero fought desperately.
He had thrown himself upon Antonio Ornano, and
wounded him with a pistol-shot in the throat. But his carbine
missed fire; Vittolo, in loading it, had put in the bullet
first. Sampiero's face was streaming with blood; freeing his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
eyes from it with his left, his right hand still grasped his
sword, and kept all at bay, when Vittolo, from behind, shot
him through the back, and he fell. The Ornanos now rushed
in upon the dying man, and finished their work. They cut
off Sampiero's head, and carried it to the Governor.
</p>

<p>
It was on the 17th of January in the year 1567 that Sampiero
fell. He had reached his sixty-ninth year, his vigour
unimpaired by age or military toil. The stern grandeur of
his soul, and his pure and heroic patriotism, have made his
name immortal. He was great in the field, inexhaustible in
council; owing all to his own extraordinary nature, without
ancestry, he inherited nothing from fortune, which usually
favours the <i>parvenu</i>, but from misfortune everything, and he
yielded, like Viriathus, only to the assassin. He has shown,
by his elevating example, what a noble man can do, when he
remains unyieldingly true to a great passion.
</p>

<p>
Sampiero was above the middle height, of proud and martial
bearing, dark and stern, with black curly hair and beard. His
eye was piercing, his words few, firm, and impressive. Though
a son of nature, and without education, he possessed acute
perceptions and unerring judgment. His friends accused him
of seeking the sovereignty of his native island; he sought
only its freedom. He lived as simply as a shepherd, wore the
woollen blouse of his country, and slept on the naked earth.
He had lived at the most luxurious courts of his time, at those
of Florence and Versailles, but he had contracted none of their
hollowness of principle, or corrupt morality. The rugged patriot
could murder his wife because she had betrayed herself
and her child to her country's enemies, but he knew nothing of
those crimes that pervert nature, and those principles that would
refine the vile abuse into a philosophy of life. He was simple,
rugged, and grand, headlong and terrible in anger, a whole
man, and fashioned in the mightiest mould of primitive nature.

SAMPIERO'S SON, ALFONSO&mdash;TREATY WITH GENOA.
</h3>

<p>
At the news of Sampiero's fall, the bells were rung in
Genoa, and the city was illuminated. The murderers quarrelled
disgracefully over their Judas-hire; that of Vittolo
amounted to one hundred and fifty gold scudi.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow and dismay fell upon the Corsican nation; its father
was slain. The people assembled in Orezza; three thousand
armed men, many weeping, all profoundly sad, filled
the square before the church. Leonardo of Casanova, Sampiero's
friend and fellow-soldier, broke the silence. He was
about to pronounce the patriot's funeral oration.
</p>

<p>
This man was at the time labouring under the severest
personal affliction. Unheard-of misfortunes had overtaken
him. He had shortly before escaped from prison, by the aid
of a heroic youth, his own son. Leonardo had been made
prisoner by the Genoese, who had thrown him into a dungeon
in Bastia. His son, Antonio, meditated plans of rescue night
and day. Disguised in the dress of the woman who brought
the prisoners their food, he made his way into his father's cell.
He conjured his father to make his escape and leave him behind;
though they should put him to death, he said, he was
but a stripling, and his death would do him honour, while it
preserved his father's arm and wisdom for his country; their
duty as patriots pointed out this course. Long and terrible
was the struggle in the father's mind. At last he saw that
he ought to do as his son had said; he tore himself from his
arms, and, wrapped in the female dress, passed safely out.
When the youth was discovered, he gave himself up without
resistance, proud and happy. They led him to the governor,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>[63]</a></span>
and, at his command, he was hung from the window of his
father's castle of Fiziani.
</p>

<p>
Leonardo, the generous victim's fate written in stern characters
on his face, rose now like a prophet before the assembled
people&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Slaves weep," he said, "free men avenge themselves!
No weak-spirited lamenting! Our mountains should re-echo
nothing but shouts of war. Let us show, by the vigour of
our measures, that he is not all dead. Has he not left us the
example of his life? The Fornari and the Vittoli cannot rob
us of that. It has escaped their ambuscades and their treacherous
balls. Why did he cry to his son, Save thyself? Doubtless
that there might still remain a hero for our country, a
head for our soldiers, a dreaded foe for the Genoese. Yes,
countrymen, Sampiero has left to his murderers the stain of
his death, and to the young Alfonso the duty of vengeance.
Let us aid in accomplishing the noble work. Close the
ranks! The spirit of the father returns to us in the son. I
know the youth. He is worthy of the name he bears, and of
the country's confidence. He has nothing of youth but its glow&mdash;the
ripeness of the judgment is sometimes in advance of the
time of life, and a ripe judgment is a gift that Heaven has not
denied him. He has long shared the dangers and toils of his
father. All the world knows he is master of the rough craft
of arms. Our soldiers are eager to march under his command,
and you may be sure their instinct is true&mdash;it never deceives
them. The masses guess their men. They are seldom mistaken
in their choice of those whom they think fit to lead
them. And, moreover, what higher tribute could you pay to
the memory of Sampiero, than to choose his son? Those who
hear me have set their hearts too high to be within the reach
of fear.
</p>

<p>
"Are there men among us base enough to prefer the shameful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
security of slavery to the storms and dangers of freedom?
Let them go, and separate themselves from the rest of the
people. But let them leave us their names. When we have
engraved these names on a pillar of eternal shame, which we
shall erect on the spot where Sampiero was assassinated, we
will send their owners off, covered with disgrace, to keep company
with Vittolo and Angelo at the court of Fornari. But
they are fools not to know that arms and battle, which are the
honourable resource of free and brave men, are also the safest
recourse of the weak. If they still hesitate, let me say to
them&mdash;On the one side stand renown for our standard, liberty
for ourselves, independence for our country; on the other, the
galleys, infamy, contempt, and all the other miseries of
slavery. Choose!"
</p>

<p>
After this speech of Leonardo's, the people elected by acclamation
Alfonso d'Ornano to be Chief and General of the
Corsicans. Alfonso was seventeen years old, but he was Sampiero's
son. The Corsicans thus, far from being broken and
cast down by the death of Sampiero, as their enemies had
hoped, set up a stripling against the proud Republic of
Genoa, mocking the veteran Genoese generals, and the name
of Doria; and for two years the youth, victorious in numerous
conflicts, held the Genoese at bay.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the long war had exhausted both sides. Genoa
was desirous of peace; the island, at that time divided by the
factions of the Rossi and Negri, was critically situated, and,
like its enemy, disposed for a cessation of hostilities. The
Republic, which had already, in 1561, resumed Corsica from
the Bank of St. George, now recalled the detested Fornari,
and sent George Doria to the island&mdash;the only man of the
name of whom the Corsicans have preserved a grateful
memory. The first measure of this wise and temperate nobleman
was to proclaim a general amnesty. Many districts tendered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
allegiance; many captains laid down their arms. The
Bishop of Sagona succeeded in persuading even the young
Alfonso to a treaty, which was concluded between him and
Genoa on the following terms:&mdash;1. Complete amnesty for
Alfonso and his adherents. 2. Liberty for them and their
families to embark for the Continent. 3. Liberty to dispose
of their property by sale, or by leaving it in trust. 4. Restoration
of the seigniory of Ornano to Alfonso. 5. Assignment
of the Pieve Vico to the partisans of Alfonso till their embarkation.
6. A space of sixty days for the settlement of their
affairs. 7. Liberty for each man to take a horse and some
dogs with him. 8. Cancelling of the liabilities of those who
were debtors to the public treasury; for all others, five years'
grace, in consideration of the great distress prevailing in the
country. 9. Liberation of certain persons then in confinement.
</p>

<p>
Alfonso left his native island with three hundred companions
in the year 1569; he went to France, where he was
honourably received by King Charles IX., who made him
colonel of the Corsican regiment he was at that time forming.
Many Corsicans went to Venice, great numbers took service
with the Pope, who organized from them the famous Corsican
Guard of the Eight Hundred.

CHAPTER I.</span>
<br /><br />

STATE OF CORSICA IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY&mdash;A GREEK COLONY
ESTABLISHED ON THE ISLAND.
</h3>

<p>
It was not till the close of the war of Sampiero that the
wretched condition of the island became fully apparent. It
had become a mere desert, and the people, decimated by the
war, and by voluntary or compulsory emigration, were plunged
in utter destitution and savagery. To make the cup of their
sorrows full, the plague several times visited the country, and
famine compelled the inhabitants to live on acorns and roots.
Besides all this, the corsairs roved along the coasts, plundered
the villages, and carried off men and women into slavery. It
was in this state George Doria found the island, when he
came over as governor; and so long as he was at the head of
its affairs, Corsica had reason to rejoice in his paternal care,
his mildness and clemency, and his conscientious observance
of the stipulations of the treaty, by which the statutes and
privileges of the Terra del Commune had been specially guaranteed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had George Doria made way for another governor,
when Genoa returned to her old mischievous policy.
People in power are usually so obstinate and blind, that they
see neither the past nor the future. Gradually the Corsicans
were again extruded from all offices, civil, military, and ecclesiastical&mdash;the
meanest posts filled with Genoese, the old
institutions suppressed, and a one-sided administration of
justice introduced. The island was considered in the light of
a Government domain. Impoverished Genoese <span lang='it_IT'><i>nobili</i></span> had
places given them there to restore their finances. The Corsicans
were involved in debt, and they now fell into the hands
of the usurers&mdash;mostly priests&mdash;to whom they had recourse, in
order to muster money for the heavy imposts. The governor
himself was to be looked on as a satrap. On his arrival in
Bastia, he received a sceptre as a symbol of his power; his
salary, paid by the country, was no trifle; and in addition,
his table had to be furnished by payments in kind&mdash;every
week a calf, and a certain quantity of fruits and vegetables.
He received twenty-five per cent. of all fines, confiscations,
and prizes of smuggled goods. His lieutenants and officials
were cared for in proportion. For he brought to the island
with him an attorney-general, a master of the ceremonies, a
secretary-general, and a private secretary, a commandant of
the ports, a captain of cavalry, a captain of police, a governor-general
of the prisons. All these officials were vampires;
Genoese writers themselves confess it. The imposts became
more and more oppressive; industry was at a stand-still;
commerce in the same condition&mdash;for the law provided that
all products of the country, when exported, should be carried
to the port of Genoa.
</p>

<p>
All writers who have treated of this period in Corsican
history, agree in saying that of all the countries in the world,
she was at that time the most unhappy. Prostrate under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
famine, pestilence, and the ravages of war; unceasingly harassed
by the Moors; robbed of her rights and her liberty by
the Genoese; oppressed, plundered; the courts of justice
venal; torn by the factions of the Blacks and Reds; bleeding
at a thousand places from family feuds and the Vendetta;
the entire land one wound&mdash;such is the picture of Corsica
in those days&mdash;an island blessed by nature with all the requisites
for prosperity. Filippini counted sixty-one fertile districts
which now lay desolate and forsaken&mdash;house and church
still standing&mdash;a sight, as he says, to make one weep. Destitute
of any other pervading principle of social cohesion, the
Corsican people must have utterly broken up, and scattered into
mere hordes, unless it had been penetrated by the sentiment
of patriotism, to an extent so universal and with a force so intense.
The virtue of patriotism shows itself here in a grandeur
almost inconceivable, if we consider what a howling
wilderness it was to which the Corsicans clung with hearts so
tender and true; a wilderness, but drenched with their blood,
with the blood of their fathers, of their brothers, and of
their children, and therefore dear. The Corsican historian
says, in the eleventh book of his history, "If patriotism has
ever been known at any time, and in any country of the
world, to exercise power over men, truly we may say that in
the island of Corsica it has been mightier than anywhere
else; for I am altogether amazed and astounded that the love
of the inhabitants of this island for their country has been so
great, as at all times to prevent them from coming to a firm
and voluntary determination to emigrate. For if we pursue
the course of their history, from the earliest inhabitants down
to the present time, we see that throughout so many centuries
this people has never had peace and quiet for so much as a
hundred years together; and that, nevertheless, they have
never resolved to quit their native island, and so avoid the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
unspeakable ruin that has followed so many and so cruel wars,
that were accompanied with dearth, with conflagration, with
feuds, with murders, with inward dissensions, with tyrannous
exercise of power by so many different nations, with plundering
of their goods, with frequent attacks of those cruel barbarians&mdash;the
corsairs, and with endless miseries besides, that it
would be tedious to reckon up." Within a period of thirty
years, twenty-eight thousand assassinations were committed
in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
"A great misfortune for Corsica," says the same historian,
"is the vast number of those accursed machines of arquebuses."
The Genoese Government drew a considerable revenue
from the sale of licenses to carry these. "There are,"
remarks Filippini, "more than seven thousand licenses at present
issued; and, besides, many carry fire-arms without any
license, and especially in the mountains, where you see nothing
but bands of twenty and thirty men, or more, all armed
with arquebuses. These licenses bring seven thousand lire
out of poor, miserable Corsica every year; for every new
governor that comes annuls the licenses of his predecessor, in
order forthwith to confirm them afresh. But the buying of the
fire-arms is the worst. For you will find no Corsican so poor
that he has not his gun&mdash;in value at least from five to six
scudi, besides the outlay for powder and ball; and those that
have no money sell their vineyard, their chestnuts, or other
possessions, that they may be able to buy one, as if it were
impossible to exist unless they did so. In truth, it is astonishing,
for the greater part of these people have not a coat
upon their back that is worth a half scudo, and in their
houses nothing to eat; and yet they hold themselves for disgraced,
if they appear beside their neighbours without a gun.
And hence it comes that the vineyards and the fields are no
longer under cultivation, and lie useless, and overgrown with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
brushwood, and the owners are compelled to betake themselves
to highway robbery and crime; and if they find no
convenient opportunity for this, then they violently make opportunity
for themselves, in order to deprive those who go
quietly about their business, and support their poor families, of
their oxen, their kine, and other cattle. From all this arises
such calamity, that the pursuit of agriculture is quite vanished
out of Corsica, though it was the sole means of support the
people had&mdash;the only kind of industry still left to these
islanders. They who live in such a mischievous manner,
hinder the others from doing so well as they might be disposed
to do: and the evil does not end here; for we hear
every day of murders done now in one village, now in another,
because of the easiness with which life can be taken by means
of the arquebuses. For formerly, when such weapons were
not in use, when foes met upon the streets, if the one was two
or three times stronger than the other, an attack was not ventured.
But now-a-days, if a man has some trifling quarrel
with another, although perhaps with a different sort of weapon
he would not dare to look him in the face, he lies down behind
a bush, and without the least scruple murders him, just
as you shoot down a wild beast, and nobody cares anything
about it afterwards; for justice dares not intermeddle. Moreover,
the Corsicans have come to handle their pieces so skilfully,
that I pray God may shield us from war; for their
enemies will have to be upon their guard, because from the
children of eight and ten years, who can hardly carry a gun,
and never let the trigger lie still, they are day and night at
the target, and if the mark be but the size of a scudo, they
hit it."
</p>

<p>
Filippini, the contemporary of Sampiero, saw fire-arms introduced
into Corsica, which were quite unknown on the island,
as he informs us, till the year 1553. Marshal Thermes&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
French, therefore&mdash;first brought fire-arms into Corsica.
"And," says Filippini, "it was laughable to see the clumsiness
of the Corsicans at first, for they could neither load nor
fire; and when they discharged, they were as frightened as
the savages." What the Corsican historian says as to the
fearful consequences of the introduction of the musket into
Corsica is as true now, after the lapse of three hundred years,
as it was then, and a chronicler of to-day could not alter an
iota of what Filippini has said.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of all this Corsican distress, we are surprised
by the sudden appearance of a Greek colony on their desolate
shores. The Genoese had striven long and hard to denationalize
the Corsican people by the introduction of foreign and
hostile elements. Policy of this nature had probably no inconsiderable
share in the plan of settling a Greek colony in
the island, which was carried into execution in the year 1676.
Some Mainotes of the Gulf of Kolokythia, weary of the intolerable
yoke of the Turks, like those ancient Phocæans who
refused to submit to the yoke of the Persians, had resolved to
migrate with wife, child, and goods, and found for themselves
a new home. After long search and much futile negotiation
for a locality, their ambassador, Johannes Stefanopulos, came
at length to Genoa, and expressed to the Senate the wishes of
his countrymen. The Republic listened to them most gladly,
and proposed for the acceptance of the Greeks the district of
Paomia, which occupies the western coast of Corsica from the
Gulf of Porto to the Gulf of Sagona. Stefanopulos convinced
himself of the suitable nature of the locality, and the Mainotes
immediately contracted an agreement with the Genoese Senate,
in terms of which the districts of Paomia, Ruvida, and Salogna,
were granted to them in perpetual fief, with a supply of
necessaries for commencing the settlement, and toleration for
their national religion and social institutions; while they on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
their part swore allegiance to Genoa, and subordinated themselves
to a Genoese official sent to reside in the colony. In
March 1676, these Greeks, seven hundred and thirty in number,
landed in Genoa, where they remained two months, previously
to taking possession of their new abode. Genoa planted this
colony very hopefully; she believed herself to have gained,
in the brave men composing it, a little band of incorruptible
fidelity, who would act as a permanent forepost in the enemy's
country. It was, in fact, impossible that the Greeks could ever
make common cause with the Corsicans. These latter gazed
on the strangers when they arrived&mdash;on the new Phocæans&mdash;with
astonishment. Possibly they despised men who seemed
not to love their country, since they had forsaken it; without
doubt they found it a highly unpleasant reflection that these
intruders had been thrust in upon their property in such an
altogether unceremonious manner. The poor Greeks were
destined to thrive but indifferently in their new rude home.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER II.</span>

<br />

INSURRECTION AGAINST GENOA.
</h3>

<p>
For half a century the island lay in a state of exhaustion&mdash;the
hatred of Genoa continuing to be fostered by general
and individual distress, and at length absorbing into itself
every other sentiment. The people lived upon their hatred;
their hatred alone prevented their utter ruin.
</p>

<p>
Many circumstances had been meanwhile combining to
bring the profound discontent to open revolt. It appeared to
the sagacious Dodici&mdash;for this body still existed, at least in
form&mdash;that a main source of the miseries of their country was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
the abuse in the matter of licensing fire-arms. Within thirty
years, as was noticed above, twenty-eight thousand assassinations
had been committed in Corsica. The Twelve urgently
entreated the Senate of the Republic to forbid the granting of
these licenses. The Senate yielded. It interdicted the selling
of muskets, and appointed a number of commissaries to
disarm the island. But as this interdict withdrew a certain
amount of yearly revenue from the exchequer, an impost of
twelve scudi was laid upon each hearth, under the name of
the <i>due seini</i>, or two sixes. The people paid, but murmured;
and all the while the sale of licenses continued, both openly
and secretly.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1724, another measure was adopted which
greatly annoyed the Corsicans. The Government of the
country was divided&mdash;the lieutenant of Ajaccio now receiving
the title of Governor&mdash;and thus a double burden and twofold
despotism henceforth pressed upon the unfortunate people.
In the hands of both governors was lodged irresponsible power
to condemn to the galleys or death, without form or procedure
of any kind; as the phrase went&mdash;<span lang='la'><i>ex informata conscientia</i></span>
(from informed conscience). An administration of justice entirely
arbitrary, lawlessness and murder were the results.
</p>

<p>
Special provocations&mdash;any of which might become the immediate
occasion of an outbreak&mdash;were not wanting. A punishment
of a disgraceful kind had been inflicted on a Corsican
soldier in a small town of Liguria. Condemned to ride a
wooden horse, he was surrounded by a jeering crowd who
made mirth of his shame. His comrades, feeling their national
honour insulted, attacked the mocking rabble, and
killed some. The authorities beheaded them for this. When
news of the occurrence reached Corsica, the pride of the
nation was roused, and, on the day for lifting the tax of the
<i>due seini</i>, a spark fired the powder in the island itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Lieutenant of Corte had gone with his collector to the
Pieve of Bozio; the people were in the fields. Only an old
man of Bustancio, Cardone by name, was waiting for the officer,
and paid him his tax. Among the coin he tendered was
a gold piece deficient in value by the amount of half a soldo.
The Lieutenant refused to take it. The old man in vain implored
him to have pity on his abject poverty; he was threatened
with an execution on his goods, if he did not produce
the additional farthing on the following day; and he went
away musing on this severity, and talking about it to himself,
as old men will do. Others met him, heard him, stopped,
and gradually a crowd collected on the road. The old
man continued his complaints; then passing from himself to
the wrongs of the country, he worked his audience into fury,
forcibly picturing to them the distress of the people, and the
tyranny of the Genoese, and ending by crying out&mdash;"It is
time now to make an end of our oppressors!" The crowd
dispersed, the words of the old man ran like wild-fire through
the country, and awakened everywhere the old gathering-cry
<span lang='it_IT'><i>Evviva la libertà!</i></span>&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>Evviva il popolo!</i></span> The conch<a name='FA_A' id='FA_A' href='#FN_A' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a> blew and
the bells tolled the alarm from village to village. A feeble old
man had thus preached the insurrection, and half a sou was
the immediate occasion of a war destined to last for forty
years. An irrevocable resolution was adopted&mdash;to pay no
further taxes of any kind whatever. This occurred in October
of the year 1729.
</p>

<p>
On hearing of the commotion among the people of Bozio,
the governor, Felix Pinelli, despatched a hundred men to the
Pieve. They passed the night in Poggio de Tavagna, having
been quietly received into the houses of the place. One of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
the inhabitants, however, named Pompiliani, conceived the
plan of disarming them during the night. This was accomplished,
and the defenceless soldiers permitted to return to
Bastia. Pompiliani was henceforth the declared head of the
insurgents. The people armed themselves with axes, bills,
pruning-knives, threw themselves on the fort of Aleria, stormed
it, cut the garrison in pieces, took possession of the arms
and ammunition, and marched without delay upon Bastia.
More than five thousand men encamped before the city, in the
citadel of which Pinelli had shut himself up. To gain time
he sent the Bishop of Mariana into the camp of the insurgents
to open negotiations with them. They demanded the removal
of all the burdens of the Corsican people. The bishop, however,
persuaded them to conclude a truce of four-and-twenty
days, to return into the mountains, and to wait for the Senate's
answer to their demands. Pinelli employed the time he
thus gained in procuring reinforcements, strengthening forts
in his neighbourhood, and fomenting dissensions. When the
people saw themselves merely trifled with and deceived, they
came down from the mountains, this time ten thousand strong,
and once more encamped before Bastia. A general insurrection
was now no longer to be prevented; and Genoa in vain
sent her commissaries to negotiate and cajole.
</p>

<p>
An assembly of the people was held in Furiani. Pompiliani,
chosen commander under the urgent circumstances of the
commencing outbreak, had shown himself incapable, and was
now set aside, making room for two men of known ability&mdash;Andrea
Colonna Ceccaldi of Vescovato, and Don Luis Giafferi
of Talasani&mdash;who were jointly declared generals of the people.
Bastia was now attacked anew and more fiercely, and the
bishop was again sent among the insurgents to sooth them if
possible. A truce was concluded for four months. Both
sides employed it in making preparations; intrigues of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
old sort were set on foot by the Genoese Commissary Camillo
Doria; but an attempt to assassinate Ceccaldi failed. The
latter had meanwhile travelled through the interior along
with Giafferi, adjusting family feuds, and correcting abuses;
subsequently they had opened a legislative assembly in Corte.
Edicts were here issued, measures for a general insurrection
taken, judicial authorities and a militia organized. A solemn
oath was sworn, never more to wear the yoke of Genoa.
The insurrection, thus regulated, became legal and universal.
The entire population, this side as well as on the other side
the mountains, now rose under the influence of one common
sentiment. Nor was the voice of religion unheard. The
clergy of the island held a convention in Orezza, and passed
a unanimous resolution&mdash;that if the Republic refused the
people their rights, the war was a measure of necessary
self-defence, and the people relieved from their oath of allegiance.

SUCCESSES AGAINST GENOA, AND GERMAN MERCENARIES&mdash;PEACE CONCLUDED.
</h3>

<p>
The canon Orticoni had been sent to the Continent to seek
the protection of the foreign powers, and Giafferi to Tuscany
to procure arms and ammunition, which were much needed;
and meanwhile the truce had expired. Genoa, refusing all concessions,
demanded unconditional submission, and the persons
of the two leaders of the revolt; but when the war was
found to break out simultaneously all over the island, and the
Corsicans had taken numbers of strong places, and formed
the sieges of Bastia, of Ajaccio, and of Calvi, the Republic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
began to see her danger, and had recourse to the Emperor
Charles VI. for aid.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor granted them assistance. He agreed to furnish
the Republic with a corps of eight thousand Germans,
making a formal bargain and contract with the Genoese, as
one merchant does with another. It was the time when the
German princes commenced the practice of selling the blood
of their children to foreign powers for gold, that it might be
shed in the service of despotism. It was also the time when
the nations began to rouse themselves; the presence of a new
spirit&mdash;the spirit of the freedom and power and progress of
the masses&mdash;began to be felt throughout the world. The poor
people of Corsica have the abiding honour of opening this
new era.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor disposed of the eight thousand Germans under
highly favourable conditions. The Republic pledged herself
to support them, to pay thirty thousand gulden monthly for
them, and to render a compensation of one hundred gulden for
every deserter and slain man. It became customary, therefore,
with the Corsicans, whenever they killed a German, to
call out, "A hundred gulden, Genoa!"
</p>

<p>
The mercenaries arrived in Corsica on the 10th of August
1731; not all however, but in the first instance, only four
thousand men&mdash;a number which the Senate hoped would
prove sufficient for its purposes. This body of Germans was
under the command of General Wachtendonk. They had
scarcely landed when they attacked the Corsicans, and compelled
them to raise the siege of Bastia.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans saw the Emperor himself interfering as their
oppressor, with grief and consternation. They were in want
of the merest necessaries. In their utter poverty they had
neither weapons, nor clothing, nor shoes. They ran to battle
bareheaded and barefoot. To what side were <i>they</i> to turn for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>[78]</a></span>
aid? Beyond the bounds of their own island they could
reckon on none but their banished countrymen. It was resolved,
therefore, at one of the diets, to summon these home,
and the following invitation was directed to them:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Countrymen! our exertions to obtain the removal of our
grievances have proved fruitless, and we have determined to
free ourselves by force of arms&mdash;all hesitation is at an end.
Either we shall rise from the shameful and humiliating prostration
into which we have sunk, or we know how to die and
drown our sufferings and our chains in blood. If no prince
is found, who, moved by the narrative of our misfortunes, will
listen to our complaints and protect us from our oppressors,
there is still an Almighty God, and we stand armed in the
name and for the defence of our country. Hasten to us, children
of Corsica! whom exile keeps at a distance from our shores,
to fight by the side of your brethren, to conquer or die!
Let nothing hold you back&mdash;take your arms and come. Your
country calls you, and offers you a grave and immortality!"
</p>

<p>
They came from Tuscany, from Rome, from Naples, from
Marseilles. Not a day passed but parties of them landed at
some port or another, and those who were not able to bear
arms sent what they could in money and weapons. One of
these returning patriots, Filician Leoni of Balagna, hitherto
a captain in the Neapolitan service, landed near San Fiorenzo,
just as his father was passing with a troop to assault the
tower of Nonza. Father and son embraced each other weeping.
The old man then said: "My son, it is well that you
have come; go in my stead, and take the tower from the
Genoese." The son instantly put himself at the head of the
troop; the father awaited the issue. Leoni took the tower
of Nonza, but a ball stretched the young soldier on the earth.
A messenger brought the mournful intelligence to his father.
The old man saw him approaching, and asked him how matters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
stood. "Not well," cried the messenger; "your son has
fallen!" "Nonza is taken?" "It is taken." "Well, then,"
cried the old man, <span lang='it_IT'>"evviva Corsica!"</span>
</p>

<p>
Camillo Doria was in the meantime ravaging the country
and destroying the villages; General Wachtendonk had led
his men into the interior to reduce the province of Balagna.
The Corsicans, however, after inflicting severe losses on him,
surrounded him in the mountains near San Pellegrino. The
imperial general could neither retreat nor advance, and was, in
fact, lost. Some voices loudly advised that these foreigners
should be cut down to a man. But the wise Giafferi was unwilling
to rouse the wrath of the Emperor against his poor
country, and permitted Wachtendonk and his army to return
unharmed to Bastia, only exacting the condition, that the
General should endeavour to gain Charles VI.'s ear for the
Corsican grievances. Wachtendonk gave his word of honour
for this&mdash;astonished at the magnanimity of men whom he had
come to crush as a wild horde of rebels. A cessation of hostilities
for two months was agreed on. The grievances of the
Corsicans were formally drawn up and sent to Vienna; but
before an answer returned, the truce had expired, and the
war commenced anew.
</p>

<p>
The second half of the imperial auxiliaries was now sent to
the island; but the bold Corsicans were again victorious in
several engagements; and on the 2d of February 1732, they
defeated and almost annihilated the Germans under Doria
and De Vins, in the bloody battle of Calenzana. The terrified
Republic hereupon begged the Emperor to send four
thousand men more. But the world was beginning to manifest
a lively sympathy for the brave people who, utterly deserted
and destitute of aid, found in their patriotism alone,
resources which enabled them so gloriously to withstand such
formidable opposition.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>[80]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The new imperial troops were commanded by Ludwig,
Prince of Würtemberg, a celebrated general. He forthwith
proclaimed an amnesty under the condition that the people
should lay down their arms, and submit to Genoa. But the
Corsicans would have nothing to do with conditions of this
kind. Würtemberg, therefore, the Prince of Culmbach,
Generals Wachtendonk, Schmettau, and Waldstein, advanced
into the country according to a plan of combined operation,
while the Corsicans withdrew into the mountains, to harass
the enemy by a guerilla warfare. Suddenly the reply of the
imperial court to the Corsican representation of grievances
arrived, conveying orders to the Prince of Würtemberg to
proceed as leniently as possible with the people, as the Emperor
now saw that they had been wronged.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th of May 1732, a peace was concluded at Corte
on the following terms&mdash;1. General amnesty. 2. That Genoa
should relinquish all claims of compensation for the expenses
of the war. 3. The remission of all unpaid taxes. 4. That
the Corsicans should have free access to all offices, civil, military,
and ecclesiastical. 5. Permission to found colleges, and
unrestricted liberty to teach therein. 6. Reinstatement of the
Council of Twelve, and of the Council of Six, with the privilege
of an Oratore. 7. The right of defence for accused persons.
8. The appointment of a Board to take cognizance of the
offences of public officials.
</p>

<p>
The fulfilment of this&mdash;for the Corsicans&mdash;advantageous
treaty, was to be personally guaranteed by the Emperor; and
accordingly, most of the German troops left the island, after
more than three thousand of their number had found a grave
in Corsica. Only Wachtendonk remained some time longer
to see the terms of the agreement carried into effect.

<br />
<br />

RECOMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES&mdash;DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE&mdash;DEMOCRATIC
CONSTITUTION OF COSTA.
</h3>

<p>
The imperial ratification was daily expected; but before
it arrived, the Genoese Senate allowed the exasperation of defeat
and the desire of revenge to hurry it into an action which
could not fail to provoke the Corsican people to new revolt.
Ceccaldi, Giafferi, the Abbé Aitelli, and Rafaelli, the leaders
of the Corsicans who had signed the treaty in the name of
their nation, were suddenly seized, and dragged off to Genoa,
under the pretext of their entertaining treasonable designs
against the state. A vehement cry of protest arose from the
whole island: the people hastened to Wachtendonk, and
urged upon him that his own honour was compromised in this
violent act of the Genoese; they wrote to the Prince of Würtemberg,
to the Emperor himself, demanding protection in
terms of the treaty. The result was that the Emperor without
delay ratified the conditions of peace, and demanded the
liberation of the prisoners. All four were set at liberty, but
the Senate endeavoured to extract a promise from them never
again to return to their country. Ceccaldi went to Spain,
where he entered into military service; Rafaelli to Rome;
Aitelli and Giafferi to Leghorn, in the vicinity of their native
island; where they could observe the course of affairs, which
to all appearance could not remain long in their present posture.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of June 1733, Wachtendonk and the last of
the German troops left the island, which, with the duly ratified
instrument of treaty in its possession, now found itself face
to face with Genoa. The two deadly foes had hardly exchanged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
glances, when both were again in arms. Nothing
but war to the knife was any longer possible between the
Corsicans and the Genoese. In the course of centuries, mutual
hate had become a second nature with both. The Genoese
citizen came to the island rancorous, intriguing, cunning; the
Corsican was suspicious, irritable, defiant, exultingly conscious
of his individual manliness, and his nation's tried powers of
self-defence. Two or three arrests and attempts at assassination,
and the people instantly rose, and gathered in Rostino,
round Hyacinth Paoli, an active, resolute, and intrepid burgher
of Morosaglia. This was a man of unusual talent, an orator,
a poet, and a statesman; for among the rugged Corsicans,
men had ripened in the school of misfortune and continual
struggle, who were destined to astonish Europe. The people
of Rostino named Hyacinth Paoli and Castineta their generals.
They had now leaders, therefore, though they were to
be considered as provisional.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the movement broken out in Rostino, and
the struggle with Genoa been once more commenced, than the
brave Giafferi threw himself into a vessel, and landed in Corsica.
The first general diet was held in Corte, which had
been taken by storm. War was unanimously declared against
Genoa, and it was resolved to place the island under the protection
of the King of Spain, whose standard was now unfurled
in Corte. The canon, Orticoni, was sent to the court of
Madrid to give expression to this wish on the part of the
Corsican people.
</p>

<p>
Don Luis Giafferi was again appointed general, and this
talented commander succeeded, in the course of the year 1734,
in depriving the Genoese of all their possessions in the island,
except the fortified ports. In the year 1735, he called a
general assembly of the people in Corte. On this occasion
he demanded Hyacinth Paoli as his colleague, and this having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
been agreed to, the advocate, Sebastiano Costa, was
appointed to draw up the scheme of a constitution. This
remarkable assembly affirmed the independence of the Corsican
people, and the perpetual separation of Corsica from
Genoa; and announced as leading features in the new arrangements&mdash;the
self-government of the people in its parliament;
a junta of six, named by parliament, and renewed every three
months, to accompany the generals as the parliament's representatives;
a civil board of four, intrusted with the oversight
of the courts of justice, of the finances, and of commercial
interests. The people in its assemblies was declared the alone
source of law. A statute-book was to be composed by the
highest junta.
</p>

<p>
Such were the prominent features of a constitution sketched
by the Corsican Costa, and approved of in the year 1735,
when universal political barbarism still prevailed upon the
Continent, by a people in regard to which the obscure rumour
went that it was horribly wild and uncivilized. It appears,
therefore, that nations are not always educated for freedom
and independence by science, wealth, or brilliant circumstances
of political prominence; oftener perhaps by poverty,
misfortune, and love for their country. A little people, without
literature, without trade, had thus in obscurity, and without
assistance, outstripped the most cultivated nations of
Europe in political wisdom and in humanity; its constitution
had not sprung from the hot-bed of philosophical systems&mdash;it
had ripened upon the soil of its material necessities.
</p>

<p>
Giafferi, Ceccaldi, and Hyacinth Paoli had all three been
placed at the head of affairs. Orticoni had returned from his
mission to Spain, with the answer that his catholic Majesty
declined taking Corsica under his special protection, but declared
that he would not support Genoa with troops. The
Corsicans, therefore, as they could reckon on no protection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
from any earthly potentate, now did as some of the Italian
republics had done during the Middle Ages, placed themselves
by general consent under the guardian care of the Virgin
Mary, whose picture henceforth figured on the standards of
the country; and they chose Jesus Christ for their <span lang='it_IT'><i>gonfaloniere</i></span>,
or standard-bearer.
</p>

<p>
Genoa&mdash;which the German Emperor, involved in the affairs
of Poland, could not now assist&mdash;was meanwhile exerting itself
to the utmost to reduce the Corsicans to subjection. The
republic first sent Felix Pinelli, the former cruel governor,
and then her bravest general, Paul Battista Rivarola, with all
the troops that could be raised. The situation of the Corsicans
was certainly desperate. They were destitute of all the
necessaries for carrying on the war; the country was completely
exhausted, and the Genoese cruisers prevented importation
from abroad. Their distress was such that they even
made proposals for peace, to which, however, Genoa refused
to listen. The whole island was under blockade; all commercial
intercourse was at an end; vessels from Leghorn had
been captured; there was a deficiency of arms, particularly
of fire-arms, and they had no powder. Their embarrassments
had become almost insupportable, when, one day, two strange
vessels came to anchor in the gulf of Isola Rossa, and began
to discharge a heavy cargo of victuals and warlike stores&mdash;gifts
for the Corsicans from unknown and mysterious donors.
The captains of the vessels scorned all remuneration, and only
asked the favour of some Corsican wine in which to drink the
brave nation's welfare. They then put out to sea again amidst
the blessings of the multitude who had assembled on the shore
to see their foreign benefactors. This little token of foreign
sympathy fairly intoxicated the poor Corsicans. Their joy
was indescribable; they rang the bells in all the villages;
they said to one another that Divine Providence, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
Blessed Virgin, had sent their rescuing angels to the unhappy
island, and their hopes grew lively that some foreign power
would at length bestow its protection on the Corsicans. The
moral impression produced by this event was so powerful, that
the Genoese feared what the Corsicans hoped, and immediately
commenced treating for peace. But it was now the turn of
the Corsicans to be obstinate.
</p>

<p>
Generous Englishmen had equipped these two ships, friends
of liberty, and admirers of Corsican heroism. Their magnanimity
was soon to come into conflict with their patriotism,
through the revolt of North America. The English supply of
arms and ammunition enabled the Corsicans to storm Aleria,
where they made a prize of four pieces of cannon. They
now laid siege to Calvi and Bastia. But their situation was
becoming every moment more helpless and desperate. All
their resources were again spent, and still no foreign power
interfered. In those days the Corsicans waited in an almost
religious suspense; they were like the Jews under the Maccabees,
when they hoped for a Messiah.
</p>

<hr class="l15 p2" />

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />
<br />

BARON THEODORE VON NEUHOFF.
</h3>

<p>
Early in the morning of the 12th of March 1736, a vessel
under British colours was seen steering towards Aleria. The
people who crowded to the shore greeted it with shouts of
joy; they supposed it was laden with arms and ammunition.
The vessel cast anchor; and soon afterwards, some of the
principal men of the island went on board, to wait on a
certain mysterious stranger whom she had brought. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>[86]</a></span>
stranger was of kingly appearance, of stately and commanding
demeanour, and theatrically dressed. He wore a long
caftan of scarlet silk, Moorish trowsers, yellow shoes, and a
Spanish hat and feather; in his girdle of yellow silk were a
pair of richly inlaid pistols, a sabre hung by his side, and in
his right hand he held a long truncheon as sceptre. Sixteen
gentlemen of his retinue followed him with respectful deference
as he landed&mdash;eleven Italians, two French officers, and
three Moors. The enigmatical stranger stepped upon the
Corsican shore with all the air of a king,&mdash;and with the purpose
to be one.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans surrounded the mysterious personage with
no small astonishment. The persuasion was general that he
was&mdash;if not a foreign prince&mdash;at least the ambassador of some
monarch now about to take Corsica under his protection.
The ship soon began to discharge her cargo before the eyes
of the crowd; it consisted of ten pieces of cannon, four thousand
muskets, three thousand pairs of shoes, seven hundred
sacks of grain, a large quantity of ammunition, some casks of
zechins, and a considerable sum in gold coins of Barbary. It
appeared that the leading men of the island had expected the
arrival of this stranger. Xaverius Matra was seen to greet
him with all the reverence due to a king; and all were impressed
by the dignity of his princely bearing, and the lofty
composure of his manner. He was conducted in triumph to
Cervione.
</p>

<p>
This singular person was a German, the Westphalian Baron
Theodore von Neuhoff&mdash;the cleverest and most fortunate of
all the adventurers of his time. In his youth he had been a
page at the court of the Duchess of Orleans, had afterwards
gone into the Spanish service, and then returned to France.
His brilliant talents had brought him into contact with all
the remarkable personages of the age; among others, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
Alberoni, with Ripperda, and Law, in whose financial speculations
he had been involved. Neuhoff had experienced everything,
seen everything, thought, attempted, enjoyed, and
suffered everything. True to the dictates of a romantic and
adventurous nature, he had run through all possible shapes
in which fortune can appear, and had at length taken it into
his head, that for a man of a powerful mind like him, it must
be a desirable thing to be a king. And he had not conceived
this idea in the vein of the crackbrained Knight of La
Mancha, who, riding errant into the world, persuaded himself
that he would at least be made emperor of Trebisonde in
reward for his achievements; on the contrary, accident threw
the thought into his quite unclouded intellect, and he resolved
to be a king, to become so in a real and natural way,&mdash;and
he became a king.
</p>

<p>
In the course of his rovings through Europe, Neuhoff had
come to Genoa just at the time when Giafferi, Ceccaldi,
Aitelli, and Rafaelli were brought to the city as prisoners. It
seems that his attention was now for the first time drawn to
the Corsicans, whose obstinate bravery made a deep impression
on him. He formed a connexion with such Corsicans as he
could find in Genoa, particularly with men belonging to the
province of Balagna; and after gaining an insight into the
state of affairs in the island, the idea of playing a part in the
history of this romantic country gradually ripened in his
mind. He immediately went to Leghorn, where Orticoni,
into whose hands the foreign relations of the island had been
committed, was at the time residing. He introduced himself
to Orticoni, and succeeded in inspiring him with admiration,
and with confidence in his magnificent promises. For, intimately
connected, as he said he was, with all the courts, he
affirmed that, within the space of a year, he would procure
the Corsicans all the necessary means for driving the Genoese
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
for ever from the island. In return, he demanded nothing
more than that the Corsicans should crown him as their
king. Orticoni, carried away by the extraordinary genius of
the man, by his boundless promises, by the cleverness of his
diplomatic, economic, and political ideas, and perceiving that
Neuhoff really might be able to do his country good service,
asked the opinion of the generals of the island. In their
desperate situation, they gave him full power to treat with
Neuhoff. Orticoni, accordingly, came to an agreement with
the baron, that he should be proclaimed king of Corsica as
soon as he put the islanders in a position to free themselves
completely from the yoke of Genoa.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Theodore von Neuhoff saw this prospect before
him, he began to exert himself for its realisation with an
energy which is sufficient of itself to convince us of his
powerful genius. He put himself in communication with the
English consul at Leghorn, and with such merchants as traded
to Barbary; he procured letters of recommendation for that
country; went to Africa; and after he had moved heaven and
earth there in person, as in Europe by his agents, finding
himself in possession of all necessary equipments, he suddenly
landed in Corsica in the manner we have described.
</p>

<p>
He made his appearance when the misery of the island
had reached the last extreme. In handing over his stores to
the Corsican leaders, he informed them that they were only a
small portion of what was to follow. He represented to them
that his connexions with the courts of Europe, already powerful,
would be placed on a new footing the moment that the
Genoese had been overcome; and that, wearing the crown,
he should treat as a prince with princes. He therefore desired
the crown. Hyacinth Paoli, Giafferi, and the learned Costa,
men of the soundest common sense, engaged upon an enterprise
the most pressingly real in its necessities that could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>[89]</a></span>
possibly be committed to human hands&mdash;that of liberating
their country, and giving its liberty a form, and secure basis,
nevertheless acceded to this desire. Their engagements to
the man, and his services; the novelty of the event, which
had so remarkably inspirited the people; the prospects of
further help; in a word, their necessitous circumstances,
demanded it. Theodore von Neuhoff, king-designate of the
Corsicans, had the house of the Bishop of Cervione appointed
him for his residence; and on the 15th of April, the people
assembled to a general diet in the convent of Alesani, in order
to pass the enactment converting Corsica into a kingdom.
The assembly was composed of two representatives from every
commune in the country, and of deputies from the convents
and clergy, and more than two thousand people surrounded
the building. The following constitution was laid before the
Parliament: The crown of the kingdom of Corsica is given
to Baron Theodore von Neuhoff and his heirs; the king is
assisted by a council of twenty-four, nominated by the people,
without whose and the Parliament's consent no measures can
be adopted or taxes imposed. All public offices are open to
the Corsicans only; legislative acts can proceed only from the
people and its Parliament.
</p>

<p>
These articles were read by Gaffori, a doctor of laws, to the
assembled people, who gave their consent by acclamation;
Baron Theodore then signed them in presence of the representatives
of the nation, and swore, on the holy gospels,
before all the people, to remain true to the constitution.
This done, he was conducted into the church, where, after
high mass had been said, the generals placed the crown upon
his head. The Corsicans were too poor to have a crown of
gold; they plaited one of laurel and oak-leaves, and crowned
therewith their first and last king. And thus Baron Theodore
von Neuhoff, who already styled himself Grandee of Spain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>[90]</a></span>
Lord of Great Britain, Peer of France, Count of the Papal
Dominions, and Prince of the Empire, became King of the
Corsicans, with the title of Theodore the First.
</p>

<p>
Though this singular affair may be explained from the then
circumstances of the island, and from earlier phenomena in
Corsican history, it still remains astonishing. So intense
was the patriotism of this people, that to obtain their liberty
and rescue their country, they made a foreign adventurer
their king, because he held out to them hopes of deliverance;
and that their brave and tried leaders, without hesitation and
without jealousy, quietly divested themselves of their authority.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />
<br />

THEODORE I., KING OF CORSICA.
</h3>

<p>
Now in possession of the kingly title, Theodore wished to
see himself surrounded by a kingly court, and was, therefore,
not sparing in his distribution of dignities. He named Don
Luis Giafferi and Hyacinth Paoli his prime ministers, and
invested them with the title of Count. Xaverius Matra became
a marquis, and grand-marshal of the palace; Giacomo
Castagnetta, count and commandant of Rostino; Arrighi,
count and inspector-general of the troops. He gave others
the titles of barons, margraves, lieutenants-general, captains
of the Royal Guard, and made them commandants of various
districts of the country. The advocate Costa, now Count
Costa, was created grand-chancellor of the kingdom, and
Dr. Gaffori, now Marquis Gaffori, cabinet-secretary to his
Majesty the constitutional king.
</p>

<p>
Ridiculous as all these pompous arrangements may appear,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>[91]</a></span>
King Theodore set himself in earnest to accomplish his task.
In a short time he had established order in the country, settled
family feuds, and organized a regular army, with which, in
April 1736, he took Porto Vecchio and Sartene from the
Genoese. The Senate of Genoa had at first viewed the
enigmatic proceedings that were going on before its eyes with
astonishment and fear, imagining that the intentions of some
foreign power might be concealed behind them. But when
obscurities cleared away, and Baron Theodore stood disclosed,
they began to lampoon him in pamphlets, and brand him as
an unprincipled adventurer deep in debt. King Theodore
replied to the Genoese manifestoes with kingly dignity, German
bluntness, and German humour. He then marched in
person against Bastia, fought like a lion before its walls, and
when he found he could not take the city, blockaded it, making,
meanwhile, expeditions into the interior of the island, in
the course of which he punished rebellious districts with unscrupulous
severity, and several times routed the Genoese
troops.
</p>

<p>
The Genoese were soon confined to their fortified towns on
the sea. In their embarrassment at this period they had recourse
to a disgraceful method of increasing their strength.
They formed a regiment, fifteen hundred strong, of their
galley-slaves, bandits, and murderers, and let loose this refuse
upon Corsica. The villanous band made frequent forays into
the country, and perpetrated numberless enormities. They
got the name of Vittoli, from Sampiero's murderer, or of
Oriundi.
</p>

<p>
King Theodore made great exertions for the general elevation
of the country. He established manufactories of arms, of
salt, of cloth; he endeavoured to introduce animation into
trade, to induce foreigners to settle in the island, by offering
them commercial privileges, and, by encouraging privateering,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
to keep the Genoese cruisers in check. The Corsican
national flag was green and yellow, and bore the motto: <span lang='la'><i>In
te Domine speravi</i></span>. Theodore had also struck his own coins&mdash;gold,
silver, and copper. These coins showed on the
obverse a shield wreathed with laurel, and above it a crown
with the initials, T. R.; on the reverse were the words:
<span lang='la'><i>Pro bono et libertate</i></span>. On the Continent, King Theodore's
money was bought up by the curious for thirty times its
value. But all this was of little avail; the promised help
did not come, the people began to murmur. The king was
continually announcing the immediate appearance of a friendly
fleet; the friendly fleet never appeared, because its promise
was a fabrication. The murmurs growing louder, Theodore
assembled a Parliament on the 2d of September, in Casacconi;
here he declared that he would lay down his crown, if the expected
help did not appear by the end of October, or that he
would then go himself to the Continent to hasten its appearance.
He was in the same desperate position in which, as
the story goes, Columbus was, when the land he had announced
would not appear.
</p>

<p>
On the dissolution of the Parliament, which, at the proposal
of the king, had agreed to a new measure of finance&mdash;a
tax upon property, Theodore mounted his horse, and went to
view his kingdom on the other side the mountains. This
region had been the principal seat of the Corsican seigniors,
and the old aristocratic feeling was still strong there. Luca
Ornano received the monarch with a deputation of the principal
gentlemen, and conducted him in festal procession to
Sartene. Here Theodore fell upon the princely idea of founding
a new order of knighthood; it was a politic idea, and, in
fact, we observe, in general, that the German baron and
Corsican king knows how to conduct himself in a politic
manner, as well as other upstarts of greater dimensions who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
have preceded and followed him. The name of the new
order was The Order of the Liberation (<span lang='it_IT'><i>della Liberazione</i></span>).
The king was grand-master, and named the cavaliers. It is
said that in less than two months the Order numbered more
than four hundred members, and that upwards of a fourth of
these were foreigners, who sought the honour of membership,
either for the mere singularity of the thing, or to indicate
their good wishes for the brave Corsicans. The membership
was dear, for it had been enacted that every cavalier should
pay a thousand scudi as entry-money, from which he was to
draw an annuity of ten per cent. for life. The Order, then, in
its best sense, was an honour awarded in payment for a
loan&mdash;a financial speculation. During his residence in Sartene,
the king, at the request of the nobles of the region,
conferred with lavish hand the titles of Count, Baron, and
Baronet, and with these the representatives of the houses of
Ornano, Istria, Rocca, and Leca, went home comforted.
</p>

<p>
While the king thus acted in kingly fashion, and filled the
island with counts and cavaliers, as if poor Corsica had overnight
become a wealthy empire, the bitterest cares of state
were preying upon him in secret. For he could not but confess
to himself that his kingdom was after all but a painted
one, and that he had surrounded himself with phantoms. The
long-announced fleet obstinately refused to appear, because it
too was a painted fleet. This chimera occasioned the king
greater embarrassment than if it had been a veritable fleet
of a hundred well-equipped hostile ships. Theodore began
to feel uncomfortable. Already there was an organized party
of malcontents in the land, calling themselves the Indifferents.
Aitelli and Rafaelli had formed this party, and Hyacinth Paoli
himself had joined it. The royal troops had even come into
collision with the Indifferents, and had been repulsed. It
seemed, therefore, as if Theodore's kingdom were about to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
burst like a soap-bubble; Giafferi alone still kept down the
storm for a while.
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances, the king thought it might be advisable
to go out of the way for a little; to leave the island,
not secretly, but as a prince, hastening to the Continent to fetch
in person the tardy succours. He called a parliament at
Sartene, announced that he was about to take his departure,
and the reason why; settled the interim government, at the
head of which he put Giafferi, Hyacinth Paoli, and Luca
Ornano; made twenty-seven Counts and Baronets governors
of provinces; issued a manifesto; and on the 11th of November
1736, proceeded, accompanied by an immense retinue, to
Aleria, where he embarked in a vessel showing French
colours, taking with him Count Costa, his chancellor, and
some officers of his household. He would have been captured
by a Genoese cruiser before he was out of sight of his kingdom,
and sent to Genoa, if he had not been protected by the
French flag. King Theodore landed at Leghorn in the dress
of an abbé, wishing to remain incognito; he then travelled
to Florence, to Rome, and to Naples, where he left his chancellor
and his officers, and went on board a vessel bound for
Amsterdam, from which city, he said, his subjects should
speedily hear good news.

<br />
<br />

GENOA IN DIFFICULTIES&mdash;AIDED BY FRANCE&mdash;THEODORE EXPELLED
HIS KINGDOM.
</h3>

<p>
The Corsicans did not believe in the return of their king,
nor in the help he promised to send them. Under the pressure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
of severe necessity, the poor people, intoxicated with
their passion for liberty, had gone so far as even to expose
themselves to the ridicule which could not fail to attach to
the kingship of an adventurer. In their despair they had
caught at a phantom, at a straw, for rescue; what would
they not have done out of hatred to Genoa, and love of freedom?
Now, however, they saw themselves no nearer the
goal they wished to reach. Many showed symptoms of discontent.
In this state of affairs, the Regents attempted to
open negotiations with Rivarola, but without result, as the
Genoese demanded unconditional submission, and surrender
of arms. An assembly of the people was called, and its voice
taken. The people resolved unhesitatingly that they must
remain true to the king to whom they had sworn allegiance,
and acknowledge no other sovereign.
</p>

<p>
Theodore had meanwhile travelled through part of Europe,
formed new connexions, opened speculations, raised money,
named cavaliers, enlisted Poles and Germans; and although
his creditors at Amsterdam threw him into a debtors' prison,
the fertile genius of the wonderful man succeeded in raising
supplies to send to Corsica. From time to time a ship reached
the island with warlike stores, and a proclamation encouraging
the Corsicans to remain steadfast.
</p>

<p>
This, and the fear that the unwearying and energetic Theodore
might at length actually win some continental power to
his side, made the Republic of Genoa anxious. The Senate had
set a price of two thousand genuini on the head of the Corsican
king, and the agents of Genoa dogged his footsteps at every
court. Herself in pecuniary difficulties, Genoa had drawn
upon the Bank for three millions, and taken three regiments
of Swiss into her pay. The guerilla warfare continued. It was
carried on with the utmost ferocity; no quarter was given now
on either side. The Republic, seeing no end of the exhausting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
struggle, resolved to call in the assistance of France. She
had hitherto hesitated to have recourse to a foreign power, as
her treasury was exhausted, and former experiences had not
been of the most encouraging kind.
</p>

<p>
The French cabinet willingly seized an opportunity, which,
if properly used, would at least prevent any other power from
obtaining a footing on an island whose position near the French
boundaries gave it so high an importance. Cardinal Fleury
concluded a treaty with the Genoese on the 12th of July
1737, in virtue of which France pledged herself to send an
army into Corsica to reduce the "rebels" to subjection.
Manifestoes proclaimed this to the Corsican people. They
produced the greatest sorrow and consternation, all the more
so, that a power now declared her intention of acting against
the Corsicans, which, in earlier times, had stood in a very different
relation to them. The Corsican people replied to these
manifestoes, by the declaration that they would never again
return under the yoke of Genoa, and by a despairing appeal
to the compassion of the French king.
</p>

<p>
In February of the year 1738, five French regiments landed
under the command of Count Boissieux. The General had
strict orders to effect, if possible, a peaceable settlement; and
the Genoese hoped that the mere sight of the French would
be sufficient to disarm the Corsicans. But the Corsicans remained
firm. The whole country had risen as one man at
the approach of the French; beacons on the hills, the conchs
in the villages, the bells in the convents, called the population
to arms. All of an age to carry arms took the field furnished
with bread for eight days. Every village formed its
little troop, every pieve its battalion, every province its camp.
The Corsicans stood ready and waiting. Boissieux now
opened negotiations, and these lasted for six months, till the
announcement came from Versailles that the Corsicans must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
submit unconditionally to the supremacy of Genoa. The
people replied in a manifesto addressed to Louis XV., that
they once more implored him to cast a look of pity upon
them, and to bear in mind the friendly interest which his
illustrious ancestors had taken in Corsica; and they declared
that they would shed their last drop of blood before they
would return under the murderous supremacy of Genoa. In
their bitter need, they meanwhile gave certain hostages required,
and expressed themselves willing to trust the French
king, and to await his final decision.
</p>

<p>
In this juncture, Baron Droste, nephew of Theodore, landed
one day at Aleria, bringing a supply of ammunition, and the
intelligence that the king would speedily return to the island.
And on the 15th of September this remarkable man actually
did land at Aleria, more splendidly and regally equipped than
when he came the first time. He brought three ships with
him; one of sixty-four guns, another of sixty, and the third
of fifty-five, besides gunboats, and a small flotilla of transports.
They were laden with munitions of war to a very considerable
amount&mdash;27 pieces of cannon, 7000 muskets with bayonets,
1000 muskets of a larger size, 2000 pistols, 24,000 pounds of
coarse and 100,000 pounds of fine powder, 200,000 pounds of
lead, 400,000 flints, 50,000 pounds of iron, 2000 lances, 2000
grenades and bombs. All this had been raised by the same
man whom his creditors in Amsterdam threw into a debtors'
prison. He had succeeded by his powers of persuasion in interesting
the Dutch for Corsica, and convincing them that a
connexion with this island in the Mediterranean was desirable.
A company of capitalists&mdash;the wealthy houses of Boom,
Tronchain, and Neuville&mdash;had agreed to lend the Corsican
king vessels, money, and the materials of war. Theodore
thus landed in his kingdom under the Dutch flag. But he
found to his dismay that affairs had taken a turn which prostrated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'>[98]</a></span>
all his hopes; and that he had to experience a fate
tinged with something like irony, since, when he came as an
adventurer he obtained a crown, but now could not be received
as king though he came as a king, with substantial
means for maintaining his dignity. He found the island split
into conflicting parties, and in active negotiation with France.
The people, it is true, led him once more in triumph to Cervione,
where he had been crowned; but the generals, his own
counts, gave him to understand that circumstances compelled
them to have nothing more to do with him, but to treat with
France. Immediately on Theodore's arrival, Boissieux had
issued a proclamation, which declared every man a rebel, and
guilty of high treason, who should give countenance to the
outlaw, Baron Theodore von Neuhoff; and the king thus saw
himself forsaken by the very men whom he had, not long before,
created counts, margraves, barons, and cavaliers. The
Dutchmen, too, disappointed in their expectations, and threatened
by French and Genoese ships, very soon made up their
minds, and in high dudgeon steered away for Naples. Theodore
von Neuhoff, therefore, also saw himself compelled to
leave the island; and vexed to the heart, he set sail for the
Continent.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />
<br />

THE FRENCH REDUCE CORSICA&mdash;NEW INSURRECTION&mdash;THE PATRIOT GAFFORI.
</h3>

<p>
In the end of October, the expected decisive document
arrived from Versailles in the form of an edict issued by the
Doge and Senate of Genoa, and signed by the Emperor and
the French king. The edict contained a few concessions, and
the express command to lay down arms and submit to Genoa.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
Boissieux gave the Corsicans fifteen days to comply with this.
They immediately assembled in the convent of Orezza to deliberate,
and to rouse the nation; and they declared in a
manifesto&mdash;"We shall not lose courage; arming ourselves
with the manly resolve to die, we shall prefer ending our lives
nobly with our weapons in our hands, to remaining idle spectators
of the sufferings of our country, living in chains, and
bequeathing slavery to our posterity. We think and say with
the Maccabees: <span lang='la'><i>Melius est mori in bello, quam videre mala
gentis nostræ</i></span>&mdash;Better to die in war, than see the miseries of
our nation."
</p>

<p>
Hostilities instantly commenced. The haughty and impetuous
Boissieux had even sent four hundred men to Borgo
to disarm the population in that quarter, before the expiry of
the time he had himself allowed. The people were still holding
their diet at Orezza. When the news came that the French
had entered Borgo, the old cry arose, <i>Evviva la libertà!
Evviva il popolo!</i> They rushed upon Borgo, attacked the
French, and shut them up in the town. The officer in command
of the corps sent messengers to Boissieux, who immediately
marched to the rescue with two thousand men. The
Corsicans, however, repulsed Boissieux, and drove his battalions
in confusion to the walls of Bastia. The French
general now sent despatches to France, asking reinforcements,
and begging to be relieved from his command on account
of sickness. Boissieux, a nephew of the celebrated
Villars, died in Bastia on the 2d of February 1739. His
successor was the Marquis of Maillebois, who landed in Corsica
in spring with a large force.
</p>

<p>
Maillebois, severe and just, swift and sure in action, was
precisely the man fitted to accomplish the task assigned to
him. He allowed the Corsicans a certain time to lay down their
arms, and on its expiry, advanced his troops at once in several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
different directions. Hyacinth Paoli, attacked in the Balagna,
was obliged to retire, and, more a politician than a soldier,
despairing of any successful resistance, he surrendered. The
result was that Giafferi did the same. Maillebois now invited
the leaders of the Corsicans to an interview with him in Morosaglia,
and represented to them that the peace of the country
required their leaving it. They yielded; and in the summer
of the year 1739, twenty-two of the leading patriots left
Corsica. Among these were Hyacinth Paoli, with his son
Pasquale, then fourteen years old, Giafferi, with his son, Castineta
and Pasqualini.
</p>

<p>
The country this side the mountains was therefore to be
considered as reduced; but on the other side, two brave kinsmen
of King Theodore still maintained themselves&mdash;his
nephews, the Baron von Droste, and Baron Frederick von
Neuhoff. After a courageous resistance&mdash;Frederick having
wandered about for some time in the woods and mountains as
guerilla&mdash;they laid down their arms on honourable terms, and
received passes to quit the island.
</p>

<p>
It was Maillebois who now, properly speaking, ruled the
island. He kept the Genoese governor in check, and, by his
vigorous, just, and wise management, restored and preserved
order. He formed all those Corsicans who were deeply compromised&mdash;and,
fearing the vengeance of Genoa, wished to
serve under the French standard&mdash;into a regiment, which
received the name of the Royal-Corse. Events on the Continent
rendering his recall necessary, he left Corsica in 1741,
and was followed soon after by the whole of the French
troops.
</p>

<p>
The island was scarcely clear of the French, when the
hatred of Genoa again blazed forth. It had become a national
characteristic, and was destined to pervade the entire history
of Corsica's connexion with Genoa. The Governor, Domenico
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>[101]</a></span>
Spinola, made an attempt to collect the impost of the <i>due
seini</i>. That instant, insurrection, fighting, and overthrow of
the Genoese. Guerilla warfare covered the whole island.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, in January 1743, the forgotten King Theodore
once more appeared. He landed one day in Isola Rossa
with three English men-of-war, and well furnished, as before,
with warlike stores. Though ignominiously driven from
his kingdom, Theodore had not given up the wish and plan
of again being king; he had gone to England, and his
zeal and energy there again effected what they had accomplished
in Amsterdam. He now anchored off the Corsican
coast, distributed his arms and ammunition, and issued proclamations,
in which he assumed the tone of an injured and
angry monarch, threatened traitors, and summoned his faithful
subjects to rally round his person. The people received
these in silence; and all that he learned convinced the unhappy
ex-king that his realm was lost for ever. With a heavy heart,
he weighed anchor and sailed away, never more to return to
his island kingdom. He went back to England.
</p>

<p>
Both Corsicans and Genoese had meanwhile become inclined
for a new treaty. An agreement was come to on
favourable conditions, which allowed the country those rights
already so often demanded and so often infringed on. During
two years things remained quiet, and there seemed some faint
prospect of a permanent peace, though the island was torn by
family feuds and the Vendetta. In order to remove these
evils, the people named three men&mdash;Gaffori, Venturini, and
Alexius Matra&mdash;protectors of the country, and these triumvirs
now appear as the national leaders. Others, however&mdash;exiled,
enterprising men&mdash;saw the smouldering glow beneath its thin
covering, and resolved to make a new assault upon the
Genoese supremacy.
</p>

<p>
Count Domenico Rivarola was at this time in the service
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
of the King of Sardinia; he was a Genoese of Bastia by birth,
but at deadly enmity with the Republic. He collected a
number of Corsicans about himself, represented to King
Charles Emanuel the probable success of an enterprise in
behalf of Corsica, obtained some ships, and with English aid
made himself master of Bastia. The Corsicans declared for
him, and the war became general. Giampetro Gaffori, a
man of unusual heroism, marched upon Corte and attacked
the citadel, which occupies a strong position on a steep crag.
The Genoese commandant saw that it must necessarily fall,
if the heavy fire of the Corsicans continued long enough to
make another breach. He therefore had Gaffori's young son,
who had been made prisoner, bound to the wall of the citadel,
in order to stop the firing. The Corsicans were horror-struck
to see Gaffori's son hanging on the wall, and their cannon
instantly became silent: not another shot was fired. Giampetro
Gaffori shuddered; then breaking the deep silence, he
shouted, "Fire!" and with redoubled fury the artillery again
began to ply upon the wall. A breach was made and stormed,
but the boy remained uninjured, and the heroic father enjoyed
the reward of clasping his son living to his breast.
</p>

<p>
On the fall of Corte, the whole interior of the island rose;
and on the 10th of August 1746, a general assembly once
more affirmed the independence of Corsica. Gaffori, Venturini,
and Matra were declared Generals and Protectors of the
nation; and an invitation was issued, calling on all Corsicans
beyond the seas to return home. The hopes of material aid
from Sardinia were, however, soon disappointed; its assistance
was found insufficient, Bastia fell again into the hands of the
Genoese, and Rivarola had been obliged to flee to Turin.
The Genoese Senate again betook itself to France, and
begged the minister to send a corps of auxiliaries against the
Corsicans.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In 1748, two thousand French troops came to Corsica
under the command of General Cursay. Their appearance
again threw the unhappy people into the utmost consternation.
As the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had extinguished every
hope of help from Sardinia, the Corsicans agreed to accept
the mediation of the King of France. Cursay himself was a
man of the noblest character&mdash;humane, benevolent, and just;
he gained the attachment of the Corsicans as soon as they
came to know him, and they willingly committed their affairs
into his hands. Accordingly, through French mediation, a
treaty was effected in July 1751, highly favourable to the
Corsicans, allowing them more privileges than they had
hitherto enjoyed, and above all, protecting their nationality.
But this treaty made Cursay incur the hatred of the Genoese;
the Republic and the French general became open enemies.
Tumult and bloodshed resulted; and the favourite of the Corsican
people would have lost his life in a disturbance at
Ajaccio, if the brave Gaffori had not hastened to his rescue.
The Genoese calumniated him at his court, asserted that he
was the cause of continual disturbances, that he neglected
his proper duties, and intrigued for his own ends&mdash;in short,
that he had views upon the crown of Corsica. This had the
desired effect; the noble Cursay was deprived of his command
and thrown into the Tower of Antibes as prisoner of state,
there to remain till his case had been tried, and sentence
pronounced.
</p>

<p>
The fate of Cursay infuriated the Corsicans; the entire
population on both sides of the mountains rose in arms. A
diet was held in Orezza, and Giampetro Gaffori created sole
General and Governor of the nation.
</p>

<p>
Gaffori now became the terror of Genoa. Sampiero himself
seemed to have risen again to life in this indomitable and
heroic spirit. He was no sooner at the head of the people,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
than he collected and skilfully organized their forces, threw
himself like lightning on the enemy, routed them in every
direction, and speedily was in possession of the entire island
except the strong seaports. Grimaldi was at this time governor;
wily and unscrupulous as Fornari had once shown himself,
he could see no safety for Genoa except in the murder
of her powerful foe. He formed a plot against his life.
Gaffori was, in Corsican fashion, involved in a Vendetta; he
had some deadly enemies, men of Corte, by name Romei.
The governor gained these men; and, to make his deed the
more abominable, he won Gaffori's own brother, Anton-Francesco,
for the plot. The conspirators inveigled Gaffori into an
ambuscade, and murdered him on the third of October 1753.
Vengeance overtook only the unnatural brother: captured a
few days after the nefarious act, he was broken on the wheel;
but the Romei found refuge with the governor. It is said
that Giampetro's wife&mdash;a woman whose heroism had already
made her famous&mdash;after the death of her husband, led her son,
a boy of twelve, to the altar, and made him swear to avenge
the murder of his father. The Corsican people had lost in
him their noblest patriot. Giampetro Gaffori, doctor of laws,
and a man of learning, possessed of the already advanced
cultivation of his century, generous, of high nobility of soul,
ready to sacrifice everything for his country&mdash;was one of the
bravest of the Corsican heroes, and worthy to be named in
the history of his country along with Sampiero. But a
nation that could, time after time, produce such men, was
invincible. Gaffori had fallen; Pasquale Paoli stood ready
to take his place.
</p>

<p>
After Giampetro's death, the people assembled as after the
death of Sampiero, to do honour to the hero by public funeral
obsequies. They then, with one voice, declared war to the
knife against Genoa, and pronounced all those guilty of capital
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
crime who should ever venture to propose a treaty with
the hereditary foe. Five individuals were placed at the head
of the government&mdash;Clemens Paoli, Hyacinth's eldest son,
Thomas Santucci, Simon Pietro Frediani, and Doctor Grimaldi.
</p>

<p>
These five conducted the affairs of the island and the war
against the Republic for two years, but it was felt necessary
that the forces of the nation should be united in one strong
hand; and a man destined to be not only an honour to his country,
but an ornament to humanity, was called home for that
purpose.

PASQUALE PAOLI.
</h3>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli was the youngest son of Hyacinth. His
father had taken him at the age of fourteen to Naples, when
he went there to live in exile. The unusual abilities of the
boy already promised a man likely to be of service to his
country. His highly cultivated father had him educated
with great care, and procured him the instructions of the
most celebrated men of the city. Naples was at that time,
and throughout the whole of the eighteenth century, in a remarkable
degree, the focus of that great Italian school of
humanistic philosophers, historians, and political economists,
which could boast such names as those of Vico, Giannone,
Filangieri, Galiani, and Genovesi. The last mentioned, the
great Italian political economist, was Pasquale's master, and
bore testimony to the genius of his pupil. From this school
issued Pasquale Paoli, one of the greatest and most practical
of those humanistic philosophers of the eighteenth century,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
who sought to realize their opinions in legislation and the
ordering of society.
</p>

<p>
It was Clemens Paoli who, when the government of the
Five was found not to answer the requirements of the country,
directed the attention of the Corsicans to his brother Paoli.
Pasquale was then an officer in the Neapolitan service; he
had distinguished himself during the war in Calabria, and
his noble character and cultivated intellect had secured
him the esteem of all who knew him. His brother Clemens
wrote to him, one day, that he must return to his native island,
for it was the will of his countrymen that he should be their
head. Pasquale, deeply moved, hesitated. "Go, my son,"
said old Hyacinth to him, "do your duty, and be the deliverer
of your country."
</p>

<p>
On the 29th of April 1755, the young Pasquale landed at
Aleria, on the same spot where, nineteen years before, Baron
Theodore had first set foot on Corsican soil. Not many years
had elapsed since then, but the aspect of things had greatly
changed. It was now a native Corsican who came to rule his
country&mdash;a young man who had no brilliant antecedents, nor
splendid connexions, on the strength of which he could promise
foreign aid; who was not a maker of projects, seeking to produce
an impression by theatrical show, but who came with empty
hands, without pretensions, modest almost to timidity, bringing
nothing with him but his love for his country, his own
force of character, and his humanistic philosophy, as the means
by which he was to transform a primitive people, reduced to a
state of savagery by family feuds, banditti-life, and the Vendetta,
to an orderly and peaceable community. The problem
was extraordinary, nay, in history unexampled; and the success
with which, before the eyes of all Europe, Paoli wrought
at its solution, at a time when similar attempts on the cultured
nations of the Continent signally failed, affords a proof
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
that the rude simplicity of nature is more susceptible of
democratic freedom than the refined corruption of polished
society.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli was now nine-and-twenty, of graceful and
vigorous make, with an air of natural dignity; his calm,
composed, unobtrusive manners, the mild and firm expression
of his features, the musical tones of his voice, his simple but
persuasive words, inspired instant confidence, and bespoke the
man of the people, and the great citizen. When the nation,
assembled in San Antonio della Casabianca, had declared Pasquale
Paoli its sole General, he at first declined the honour,
pleading his youth and inexperience; but the people would
not even give him a colleague. On the 15th of July 1755,
Pasquale Paoli placed himself at the helm of his country.
</p>

<p>
He found his country in this condition: the Genoese, confined
to their fortified towns, making preparations for war;
the greater part of the island free; the people grown savage,
torn by faction and family feud; the laws obsolete; agriculture,
trade, science, neglected or non-existent; the material
everywhere raw and in confusion, but full of the germs of a
healthy life, implanted by former centuries, and in the subsequent
course of events not stifled, but strengthened and encouraged;
finally, he had to deal with a people whose noblest
qualities&mdash;love of country and love of freedom&mdash;had been
stimulated to very madness.
</p>

<p>
Paoli's very first measures struck at the root of abuses. A
law was enacted punishing the Vendetta with the pillory, and
death at the hands of the public executioner. Not only fear,
but the sense of honour, and the moral sentiment, were called
into action. Priests&mdash;missionaries against the Vendetta&mdash;travelled
over the country, and preached in the fields, inculcating
the forgiveness of enemies. Paoli himself made a journey
through the island to reconcile families at feud with each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108'>[108]</a></span>
other. One of his relations had, in spite of the law, committed
a murderous act of vengeance. Paoli did not hesitate a moment;
he let the law take its course upon his relative, and he
was executed. This firm and impartial administration of justice
made a deep impression, and produced wholesome results.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of activity of this kind, Paoli was surprised by
the intelligence that Emanuel Matra had collected his adherents,
raised the standard of revolt, and was marching against
him. Matra, who belonged to an ancient family of Caporali
from beyond the mountains, had been driven to this course by
ambition and envy. He had himself reckoned on obtaining
the highest position in the state, and it was to wrest it from
his rival that he was now in arms. He was a dangerous opponent.
Paoli wished to save his country from a civil war,
and proposed to Matra that the sword should remain sheathed,
and that an assembly of the people should decide which of
them was to be General of the nation. The haughty Matra
of course rejected this proposal, boastfully intimating his reliance
on his own abilities, military experience, and even on
support from Genoa. He defeated the troops of Paoli in
several engagements, but was afterwards repulsed with serious
loss. In the spring of 1756, he again took the field with
Genoese auxiliaries, and made a sudden and fierce attack on
Paoli in Bozio. Pasquale, who had only a few men with him,
hastily entrenched himself in the convent. A furious assault
was made upon the cloister; the danger was imminent; already
the doors were on fire, and the flames penetrating to the
interior. Paoli gave himself up for lost. Suddenly conchs
were heard from the hills, and a band of brave friends, led by
his brother Clemens, and Thomas Carnoni, hitherto at deadly
feud with Pasquale, and armed by his own mother for the rescue
of his foe, rushed down upon the besiegers. The fight
became desperate. It is said that Matra fought with unheard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
of ferocity after all his men had fallen or fled, and that he
continued the struggle even when a ball had brought him
upon his knee, until another shot stretched him on the earth.
Paoli wept over the body of his enemy, to see a man of such
heroic energy dead among traitors, and lost to his country's
cause. The danger was now happily over, and the party of
the Matras annihilated; a few of them had reached Bastia,
and waited there in safety with the Genoese, till a favourable
opportunity should occur for again emerging.
</p>

<p>
It was apparent, however, that Genoa was now exhausted.
This once powerful Republic had grown old, and was on the
eve of its fall. Alarmed at the progress of the Corsicans, she
indeed made some attempts to check it by force of arms, but
these no longer made such impression as in the days of the
Dorias and Spinolas. The Republic several times took Swiss
and Germans into her service; and on one occasion attacked
Paoli's head-quarters at Furiani in the neighbourhood of Bastia,
but without success. She had recourse again to France.
The French cabinet, to prevent the English from throwing a
garrison into some of the seaports, garrisoned the fortified
towns in 1756. But the French remained otherwise neutral,
doing no more than keeping possession of these cities, which
they again evacuated in the year 1759.
</p>

<p>
Genoa lost heart. She saw Corsica rapidly becoming a
compact and well-regulated state, and exhibiting the most
marked signs of increased prosperity. The finances, and the
administration generally, were managed with skill; agriculture
was advancing, manufactories, even powder-mills, were
in operation; the new city of Isola Rossa had risen under the
very eyes of the foe; Paoli had actually fitted out a fleet, and
the Corsican cruisers made the sea unsafe for Genoese vessels.
The whole of Corsica, cleared of family broils, stood completely
prepared for defence and offence; the last of the strong towns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>[110]</a></span>
still in the possession of the Republic were more and more
closely blockaded, and their fall seemed now at least not impossible.
So rapidly had the Corsican people developed its
resources under a wise government, that it now no longer
stood in need of foreign aid. Genoa would willingly have
made peace, but the Corsicans declared that they would only
do this when the Genoese had entirely quitted the island.
</p>

<p>
Once more the Republic tried war. She again had recourse
to the Matra family&mdash;to Antonio and Alexius Matra, the latter
of whom had once been Regent along with Gaffori. These
men, who were, one after the other, made Genoese marshals,
and furnished with troops, excited revolts, which were crushed
after a short struggle. The Genoese began to see that the Corsicans
were no longer to be subdued unless by a serious attack
on the part of France, and on the 7th of August 1764, they
concluded a new treaty with the French king at Compiègne,
according to which the latter pledged himself to hold the seaports
for four years. Six battalions of French soldiery now
landed in Corsica, under command of Count Marb&oelig;uf, who
announced to the Corsicans that it was his purpose to observe
strict neutrality between them and the Genoese, as he should
give effect to the treaty if he merely garrisoned the seaports.
It was, however, itself an act of hostility towards the Corsicans,
to garrison these towns&mdash;a procedure which they were
not in a position to hinder; and a neutrality which bound
their hands, and forced them to raise sieges already far advanced
towards success, did not deserve the name. They
complained and protested, but they raised the siege of San
Fiorenzo, which was near its fall.
</p>

<p>
Affairs continued in this undetermined state for four years;
the Genoese inactive; the French maintaining an independent
position in relation to their allies&mdash;occupying the fortified
towns, and on terms of friendly intercourse with the Corsicans;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
these latter in full activity, strengthening their constitution,
rejoicing in their independence, and indulging the fond hope
that they would come into complete possession of their island
after the lapse of the four years of the treaty, and thus at
length attain the goal of their heroic national struggles.
</p>

<p>
All Europe was full of admiration for them, and praised
the Corsican constitution as the model of a free and popular
form of government. Certainly it was praiseworthy in its
simplicity and thorough practical efficiency; the political
wisdom of the century of the Humanists has raised for itself
no nobler monument.

PAOLI'S LEGISLATION.
</h3>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli, in giving form to the Corsican Republic,
proceeded on the simple principle that the people are the
alone source of authority and law, and that the whole design
of the latter is to effect and preserve the people's welfare. His
idea as to the government was that it should form a kind of
national jury, subdivided into as many branches as there were
branches of the administration, and that the entire system
ought to resemble an edifice of crystal, in which all could see
what was going on, as it appeared to him that mystery and
concealment favoured arbitrary exercise of power, and engendered
distrust in the nation.
</p>

<p>
As the basis of his constitution, Paoli adopted the old popular
arrangements of the Terra del Commune, with its Communes,
Pieves, Podestàs, and Fathers of Communities.
</p>

<p>
All citizens above the age of twenty-five had a vote in the
election of a member for the General Assembly (<i>consulta</i>).
They met under the presidency of the Podestà of the place,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
and gave an oath that they would only elect such men as
they held worthiest.
</p>

<p>
Every thousand of the population sent a representative to
the Consulta. The sovereign power was vested in the Consulta
in the name of the people. It was composed of the
deputies of the Communes, and clergy; the magistrates of
each province also sent their president as deputy. The Consulta
imposed taxes, decided on peace or war, and enacted
the laws. A majority of two-thirds was required to give a
measure legal force.
</p>

<p>
The Consulta nominated from among its own numbers the
Supreme Council (<span lang='it_IT'><i>consiglio supremo</i></span>)&mdash;a body of nine men,
answering to the nine free provinces of Corsica&mdash;Nebbio,
Casinca, Balagna, Campoloro, Orezza, Ornano, Rogna, Vico,
and Cinarca. In the Supreme Council was vested the executive
power; it summoned the Consulta, represented it in
foreign affairs, regulated public works, and watched in general
over the security of the country. In cases of unusual importance
it was the last appeal, and was privileged to interpose
a veto on the resolutions of the Consulta till the matter
in question had been reconsidered. Its president was the
General of the nation, who could do nothing without the approval
of this council.
</p>

<p>
Both powers, however&mdash;the council as well as the president&mdash;were
responsible to the people, or their representatives, and
could be deposed and punished by a decree of the nation.
The members of the Supreme Council held office for one year;
they were required to be above thirty-five years of age, and
to have previously been representatives of the magistracy of a
province.
</p>

<p>
The Consulta also elected the five syndics, or censors. The
duty of the Syndicate was to travel through the provinces, and
hear appeals against the general or the judicial administration
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
of any particular district; its sentence was final, and could
not be reversed by the General. The General named persons
to fill the public offices, and the collectors of taxes, all of
whom were subject to the censorship of the Syndicate.
</p>

<p>
Justice was administered as follows:&mdash;Each Podestà could
decide in cases not exceeding the value of ten livres. In
conjunction with the Fathers of the Community, he could
determine causes to the value of thirty livres. Cases involving
more than thirty livres were tried before the tribunal of
the province, where the court consisted of a president and
two assessors named by the Consulta, and of a fiscal named
by the Supreme Council. This tribunal was renewed every
year.
</p>

<p>
An appeal lay from it to the Rota Civile, the highest court
of justice, consisting of three doctors of laws, who held office
for life. The same courts administered criminal justice, assisted
always by a jury consisting of six fathers of families,
who decided on the merits of the case from the evidence furnished
by the witnesses, and pronounced a verdict of guilty
or not guilty.
</p>

<p>
The members of the supreme council, of the Syndicate, and
of the provincial tribunals, could only be re-elected after a
lapse of two years. The Podestàs and Fathers of the Communities
were elected annually by the citizens of their locality
above twenty-five years of age.
</p>

<p>
In cases of emergency, when revolt and tumult had broken
out in some part of the island, the General could send a temporary
dictatorial court into the quarter, called the War
Giunta (<span lang='it_IT'><i>giunta di osservazione o di guerra</i></span>), consisting of
three or more members, with one of the supreme councillors
at their head. Invested with unlimited authority to adopt
whatever measures seemed necessary, and to punish instantaneously,
this swiftly-acting "court of high commission"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
could not fail to strike terror into the discontented and evil-disposed;
the people gave it the name of the <span lang='it_IT'><i>Giustizia Paolina</i></span>.
Having fulfilled its mission, it rendered an account of its
proceedings to the Censors.
</p>

<p>
Such is an outline of Paoli's legislation, and of the constitution
of the Corsican Republic. When we consider its leading
ideas&mdash;self-government of the people, liberty of the individual
citizen protected and regulated on every side by law,
participation in the political life of the country, publicity and
simplicity in the administration, popular courts of justice&mdash;we
cannot but confess that the Corsican state was constructed
on principles of a wider and more generous humanity than
any other in the same century. And if we look at the time
when it took its rise, many years before the world had seen
the French democratic legislation, or the establishment of
the North American republic under the great Washington,
Pasquale Paoli and his people gain additional claims to our
admiration.
</p>

<p>
Paoli disapproved of standing armies. He himself said:&mdash;"In
a country which desires to be free, each citizen must be
a soldier, and constantly in readiness to arm himself for the
defence of his rights. Paid troops do more for despotism than
for freedom. Rome ceased to be free on the day when she
began to maintain a standing army; and the unconquerable
phalanxes of Sparta were drawn immediately from the ranks
of her citizens. Moreover, as soon as a standing army has
been formed, <span lang='fr_FR'><i>esprit de corps</i></span> is originated, the bravery of this
regiment and that company is talked of&mdash;a more serious evil
than is generally supposed, and one which it is well to avoid
as far as possible. We ought to speak of the intrepidity of
the particular citizen, of the resolute bravery displayed by
this commune, of the self-sacrificing spirit which characterizes
the members of that family; and thus awaken emulation in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
a free people. When our social condition shall have become
what it ought to be, our whole people will be disciplined, and
our militia invincible."
</p>

<p>
Necessity compelled Paoli to yield so far in this matter, as
to organize a small body of regular troops to garrison the
forts. These consisted of two regiments of four hundred men
each, commanded by Jacopo Baldassari and Titus Buttafuoco.
Each company had two captains and two lieutenants; French,
Prussian, and Swiss officers gave them drill. Every regular
soldier was armed with musket and bayonet, a pair of pistols,
and a dagger. The uniform was made from the black woollen
cloth of the country; the only marks of distinction for the
officers were, that they wore a little lace on the coat-collar,
and had no bayonet in their muskets. All wore caps of the
skin of the Corsican wild-boar, and long gaiters of calf-skin
reaching to the knee. Both regiments were said to be highly
efficient.
</p>

<p>
The militia was thus organized: All Corsicans from sixteen
to sixty were soldiers. Each commune had to furnish
one or more companies, according to its population, and chose
its own officers. Each pieve, again, formed a camp, under a
commandant named by the General. The entire militia was
divided into three levies, each of which entered for fifteen
days at a time. It was a generally-observed rule to rank
families together, so that the soldiers of a company were
mostly blood-relations. The troops in garrison received yearly
pay, the others were paid only so long as they kept the field.
The villages furnished bread.
</p>

<p>
The state expenses were met from the tax of two livres
on each family, the revenues from salt, the coral-fishery, and
other indirect imposts.
</p>

<p>
Nothing that can initiate or increase the prosperity of a
people was neglected by Paoli. He bestowed special attention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
on agriculture; the Consulta elected two commissaries yearly
for each province, whose business it was to superintend and
foster agriculture in their respective districts. The cultivation
of the olive, the chestnut, and of maize, was encouraged;
plans for draining marshes and making roads were proposed.
With one hand, at that period, the Corsican warded off his
foe, as soldier; with the other, as husbandman, he scattered
his seed upon the soil.
</p>

<p>
Paoli also endeavoured to give his people mental cultivation&mdash;the
highest pledge and the noblest consummation of
all freedom and all prosperity. The iron times had hitherto
prevented its spread. The Corsicans had remained children
of nature; they were ignorant, but rich in mother-wit. Genoa,
it is said, had intentionally neglected the schools; but now,
under Paoli's government, their numbers everywhere increased,
and the Corsican clergy, brave and liberal men, zealously instructed
the youth. A national printing-house was established
in Corte, from which only books devoted to the
instruction and enlightenment of the people issued. The
children found it written in these books, that love of his
native country was a true man's highest virtue; and that all
those who had fallen in battle for liberty had died as martyrs,
and had received a place in heaven among the saints.
</p>

<p>
On the 3d of January 1765, Paoli opened the Corsican
university. In this institution, theology, philosophy, mathematics,
jurisprudence, philology, and the belles-lettres were
taught. Medicine and surgery were in the meantime omitted,
till Government was in a position to supply the necessary
instruments. All the professors were Corsicans; the leading
names were Guelfucci of Belgodere, Stefani of Benaco,
Mariani of Corbara, Grimaldi of Campoloro, Ferdinandi of
Brando, Vincenti of Santa Lucia. Poor scholars were supported
at the public expense. At the end of each session, an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
examination took place before the members of the Consulta
and the Government. Thus the presence of the most esteemed
citizens of the island heightened both praise and blame. The
young men felt that they were regarded by them, and by the
people in general, as the hope of their country's future, and
that they would soon be called upon to join or succeed them
in their patriotic endeavours. Growing up in the midst of the
weighty events of their own nation's stormy history, they had
the one high ideal constantly and vividly before their eyes.
The spirit which accordingly animated these youths may
readily be imagined, and will be seen from the following
fragment of one of the orations which it was customary for
some student of the Rhetoric class to deliver in presence of
the representatives and Government of the nation.
</p>

<p>
"All nations that have struggled for freedom have endured
great vicissitudes of fortune. Some of them were less
powerful and less brave than our own; nevertheless, by their
resolute steadfastness they at last overcame their difficulties.
If liberty could be won by mere talking, then were the whole
world free; but the pursuit of freedom demands an unyielding
constancy that rises superior to all obstacles&mdash;a virtue so rare
among men that those who have given proof of it have always
been regarded as demigods. Certainly the privileges of a free
people are too valuable&mdash;their condition too fortunate, to be
treated of in adequate terms; but enough is said if we remember
that they excite the admiration of the greatest men. As
regards ourselves, may it please Heaven to allow us to follow
the career on which we have entered! But our nation, whose
heart is greater than its fortunes, though it is poor and goes
coarsely clad, is a reproach to all Europe, which has grown
sluggish under the burden of its heavy chains; and it is now
felt to be necessary to rob us of our existence.
</p>

<p>
"Brave countrymen! the momentous crisis has come. Already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
the storm rages over our heads; dangers threaten on
every side; let us see to it that we maintain ourselves superior
to circumstances, and grow in strength with the number
of our foes; our name, our freedom, our honour, are at stake!
In vain shall we have exhibited heroic endurance up till the
present time&mdash;in vain shall our forefathers have shed streams
of blood and suffered unheard-of miseries; if <i>we</i> prove weak,
then all is irremediably lost. If we prove weak! Mighty
shades of our fathers! ye who have done so much to bequeath
to us liberty as the richest inheritance, fear not that we shall
make you ashamed of your sacrifices. Never! Your children
will faithfully imitate your example; they are resolved
to live free, or to die fighting in defence of their inalienable
and sacred rights. We cannot permit ourselves to believe
that the King of France will side with our enemies, and direct
his arms against our island; surely this can never happen.
But if it is written in the book of fate, that the most powerful
monarch of the earth is to contend against one of the smallest
peoples of Europe, then we have new and just cause to be
proud, for we are certain either to live for the future in honourable
freedom, or to make our fall immortal. Those who
feel themselves incapable of such virtue need not tremble; I
speak only to true Corsicans, and their feelings are known.
</p>

<p>
"As regards us, brave youths, none&mdash;I swear by the manes
of our fathers!&mdash;not one will wait a second call; before the
face of the world we must show that we deserve to be called
brave. If foreigners land upon our coasts ready to give battle
to uphold the pretensions of their allies, shall we who fight for
our own welfare&mdash;for the welfare of our posterity&mdash;for the
maintenance of the righteous and magnanimous resolutions of
our fathers&mdash;shall we hesitate to defy all dangers, to risk, to
sacrifice our lives? Brave fellow-citizens! liberty is our aim&mdash;and
the eyes of all noble souls in Europe are upon us; they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
sympathize with us, they breathe prayers for the triumph of
our cause. May our resolute firmness exceed their expectations!
and may our enemies, by whatever name called, learn
from experience that the conquest of Corsica is not so easy as
it may seem! We who live in this land are freemen, and
freemen can die!"

CORSICA UNDER PAOLI&mdash;TRAFFIC IN NATIONS&mdash;VICTORIES OVER THE FRENCH.
</h3>

<p>
All the thoughts and wishes of the Corsican people were
thus directed towards a common aim. The spirit of the nation
was vigorous and buoyant; ennobled by the purest love of
country, by a bravery that had become hereditary, by the
sound simplicity of the constitution, which was no artificial
product of foreign and borrowed theorizings, but the fruit of
sacred, native tradition. The great citizen, Pasquale Paoli,
was the father of his country. Wherever he showed himself,
he was met by the love and the blessings of his people, and
women and gray-haired men raised their children and children's
children in their arms, that they might see the man
who had made his country happy. The seaports, too, which
had hitherto remained in the power of Genoa, became desirous
of sharing the advantages of the Corsican constitution. Disturbances
occurred; Carlo Masseria and his son undertook to
deliver the castle of Ajaccio into the hands of the Nationalists
by stratagem. The attempt failed. The son was killed, and
the father, who had already received his death-wound, died
without a complaint, upon the rack.
</p>

<p>
The Corsican people had now become so much stronger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
that, far from turning anxiously to some foreign power for
aid, they found in themselves, not only the means of resistance,
but even of attack and conquest. Their flag already
waved on the waters of the Mediterranean. De Perez, a
knight of Malta, was the admiral of their little fleet, which
was occasioning the Genoese no small alarm. People said in
Corsica that the position of the island might well entitle it to
become a naval power&mdash;such as Greek islands in the eastern
seas had formerly been; and a landing of the Corsicans on
the coast of Liguria was no longer held impossible.
</p>

<p>
The conquest of the neighbouring island of Capraja gave
such ideas a colour of probability; while it astonished the
Genoese, and showed them that their fears were well grounded.
This little island had in earlier times been part of the seigniory
of the Corsican family of Da Mare, but had passed into
the hands of the Genoese. It is not fertile, but an important
and strong position in the Genoese and Tuscan waters. A
Corsican named Centurini conceived the idea of surprising it.
Paoli readily granted his consent, and in February 1765 a
little expedition, consisting of two hundred regular troops and
a body of militia, ran out from Cape Corso. They attacked
the town of Capraja, which at first resisted vigorously, but
afterwards made common cause with them. The Genoese
commandant, Bernardo Ottone, held the castle, however, with
great bravery; and Genoa, as soon as it heard of the occurrence,
hastily despatched her fleet under Admiral Pinelli, who
thrice suffered a repulse. In Genoa, such was the shame and
indignation at not being able to rescue Capraja from the
handful of Corsicans who had effected a lodgment in the
town, that the whole Senate burst into tears. Once more
they sent their fleet, forty vessels strong, against the island.
The five hundred Corsicans under Achille Murati maintained
the town, and drove the Genoese back into the sea. Bernardo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
Ottone surrendered in May 1767, and Capraja, now completely
in possession of the Corsicans, was declared their province.
</p>

<p>
The fall of Capraja was a heavy blow to the Senate, and
accelerated the resolution totally to relinquish the now untenable
Corsica. But the enfeebled Republic delayed putting
this painful determination into execution, till a blunder she
herself committed forced her to it. It was about this time
that the Jesuits were driven from France and Spain; the
King of Spain had, however, requested the Genoese Senate
to allow the exiles an asylum in Corsica. Genoa, to show
him a favour, complied, and a large number of the Jesuit
fathers one day landed in Ajaccio. The French, however,
who had pronounced sentence of perpetual banishment on
the Jesuits, regarded it as an insult on the part of Genoa,
that the Senate should have opened to the fathers the Corsican
seaports which they, the French, garrisoned. Count
Marb&oelig;uf immediately received orders to withdraw his troops
from Ajaccio, Calvi, and Algajola; and scarcely had this
taken place, when the Corsicans exultingly occupied the city
of Ajaccio, though the citadel was still in possession of a body
of Genoese troops.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, and considering the irritated
state of feeling between France and Genoa, the Senate foresaw
that it would have to give way to the Corsicans; it accordingly
formed the resolution to sell its presumed claims
upon the island to France.
</p>

<p>
The French minister, Choiseul, received the proposal with
joy. The acquisition of so important an island in the
Mediterranean seemed no inconsiderable advantage, and in
some degree a compensation for the loss of Canada. The
treaty was concluded at Versailles on the 15th of May
1768, and signed by Choiseul on behalf of France, and Domenico
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
Sorba on behalf of Genoa. The Republic thus, contrary
to all national law, delivered a nation, on which it had
no other claim than that of conquest&mdash;a claim, such as it was,
long since dilapidated&mdash;into the hands of a foreign despotic
power, which had till lately treated with the same nation as
with an independent people; and a free and admirably constituted
state was thus bought and sold like some brutish herd.
Genoa had, moreover, made the disgraceful stipulation that
she should re-enter upon her rights, as soon as she was in a
position to reimburse the expenses which France had incurred
by her occupation of the island.
</p>

<p>
Before the French expedition quitted the harbours of Provence,
rumours of the negotiations, which were at first kept
secret, had reached Corsica. Paoli called a Consulta at
Corte; and it was unanimously resolved to resist France to
the last and uttermost, and to raise the population <span lang='fr_FR'><i>en masse</i></span>.
Carlo Bonaparte, father of Napoleon, delivered a manly and
spirited speech on this occasion.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Count Narbonne had landed with troops in
Ajaccio; and the astonished inhabitants saw the Genoese
colours lowered, and the white flag of France unfurled in
their stead. The French still denied the real intention of
their coming, and amused the Corsicans with false explanations,
till the Marquis Chauvelin landed with all his troops in
Bastia, as commander-in-chief.
</p>

<p>
The four years' treaty of occupation was to expire on the
7th August of the same year, and on that day it was expected
hostilities would commence. But on the 30th of July, five
thousand French, under the command of Marb&oelig;uf, marched
from Bastia towards San Fiorenzo, and after some unsuccessful
resistance on the part of the Corsicans, made themselves
masters of various points in Nebbio. It thus became clear
that the doom of the Corsicans had been pronounced. Fortune,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
always unkind to them, had constantly interposed foreign
despots between them and Genoa; and regularly each time,
as they reached the eve of complete deliverance, had hurled
them back into their old misery.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli hastened to the district of Nebbio with some
militia. His brother Clemens had already taken a position
there with four thousand men. But the united efforts of both
were insufficient to prevent Marb&oelig;uf from making himself
master of Cape Corso. Chauvelin, too, now made his appearance
with fifteen thousand French, sent to enslave the freest
and bravest people in the world. He marched on the strongly
fortified town of Furiani, accompanied by the traitor, Matias
Buttafuoco of Vescovato&mdash;the first who loaded himself with
the disgrace of earning gold and title from the enemy. Furiani
was the scene of a desperate struggle. Only two hundred
Corsicans, under Carlo Saliceti and Ristori, occupied the
place; and they did not surrender even when the cannon of
the enemy had reduced the town to a heap of ruins, but,
sword in hand, dashed through the midst of the foe during
the night, and reached the coast.
</p>

<p>
Conflicts equally sanguinary took place in Casinca, and on
the Bridge of Golo. The French were repulsed at every
point, and Clemens Paoli covered himself with glory. History
mentions him and Pietro Colle as the heroes of this last
struggle of the Corsicans for freedom.
</p>

<p>
The remains of the routed French threw themselves into
Borgo, an elevated town in the mountains of Mariana, and
reinforced its garrison. Paoli was resolved to gain the place,
cost what it might; and he commenced his assault on the
1st of October, in the night. It was the most brilliant of all
the achievements of the Corsicans. Chauvelin, leaving Bastia,
moved to the relief of Borgo; he was opposed by Clemens,
while Colle, Grimaldi, Agostini, Serpentini, Pasquale Paoli,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
and Achille Murati led the attack upon Borgo. Each side
expended all its energies. Thrice the entire French army
made a desperate onset, and it was thrice repulsed. The
Corsicans, numerically so much inferior, and a militia, broke
and scattered here the compact ranks of an army which, since
the age of Louis XIV., had the reputation of being the best
organized in Europe. Corsican women in men's clothes, and
carrying musket and sword, were seen mixing in the thickest of
the fight. The French at length retired upon Bastia. They
had suffered heavily in killed and wounded&mdash;among the latter
was Marb&oelig;uf; and seven hundred men, under Colonel Ludre,
the garrison of Borgo, laid down their arms and surrendered
themselves prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The battle of Borgo showed the French what kind of
people they had come to enslave. They had now lost all the
country except the strong seaports. Chauvelin wrote to his
court, reported his losses, and demanded new troops. Ten
fresh battalions were sent.

THE DYING STRUGGLE.
</h3>

<p>
The sympathy for the Corsicans had now become livelier
than ever. In England especially, public opinion spoke
loudly for the oppressed nation, and called upon the Government
to interfere against such shameless and despotic exercise
of power on the part of France. It was said Lord Chatham
really entertained the idea of intimating England's decided
disapproval of the French policy. Certainly the eyes of the
Corsicans turned anxiously towards the free and constitutional
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
Great Britain; they hoped that a great and free nation would
not suffer a free people to be crushed. They were deceived.
The British cabinet forbade, as in the year 1760, all intercourse
with the Corsican "rebels." The voice of the English
people became audible only here and there in meetings, and
with these and private donations of money, the matter rested.
The cabinets, however, were by no means sorry that a perilous
germ of democratic freedom should be stifled along with a
heroic nationality.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli saw well how dangerous his position was,
notwithstanding the success that had attended the efforts of his
people. He made proposals for a treaty, the terms of which
acknowledged the authority of the French king, left the Corsicans
their constitution, and allowed the Genoese a compensation.
His proposals were rejected; and preparations continued
to be made for a final blow. Chauvelin meanwhile felt his
weakness. It has been affirmed that he allowed the Genoese
to teach him intrigue; Paoli, like Sampiero and Gaffori, was
to be removed by the hand of the assassin. Treachery is
never wanting in the history of brave and free nations; it
seems as if human nature could not dispense with some shadow
of baseness where its nobler qualities shine with the
purest light. A traitor was found in the son of Paoli's own
chancellor, Matias Maffesi; letters which he lost divulged his
secret purpose. Placed at the bar of the Supreme Council, he
confessed, and was delivered over to the executioner. Another
complot, formed by the restless Dumouriez, at that time
serving in Corsica, to carry off Paoli during the night from
his own house at Isola Rossa, also failed.
</p>

<p>
Chauvelin had brought his ten new battalions into the field,
but they had met with a repulse from the Corsicans in Nebbio.
Deeply humiliated, the haughty Marquis sent new messengers
to France to represent the difficulty of subduing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
Corsica. The French government at length recalled Chauvelin
from his post in December 1768, and Marb&oelig;uf was
made interim commander, till Chauvelin's successor, Count
de Vaux, should arrive.
</p>

<p>
De Vaux had served in Corsica under Maillebois; he knew
the country, and how a war in it required to be conducted.
Furnished with a large force of forty-five battalions, four
regiments of cavalry, and considerable artillery, he determined
to end the conflict at a single blow. Paoli saw how
heavily the storm was gathering, and called an assembly
in Casinca on the 15th of April 1769. It was resolved to
fight to the last drop of blood, and to bring every man in Corsica
into the field. Lord Pembroke, Admiral Smittoy, other
Englishmen, Germans, and Italians, who were present, were
astonished by the calm determination of the militia who flocked
into Casinca. Many foreigners joined the ranks of the Corsicans.
A whole company of Prussians, who had been in the
service of Genoa, came over to their side. No one, however,
could conceal from himself the gloominess of the Corsican
prospects; French gold was already doing its work; treachery
was rearing its head; even Capraja had fallen through the
treasonable baseness of its commandant, Astolfi.
</p>

<p>
Corsica's fatal hour was at hand. England did not, as had
been hoped, interfere; the French were advancing in full
force upon Nebbio. This mountain province, traversed by a
long, narrow valley, had frequently already been the scene of
decisive conflicts. Paoli, leaving Saliceti and Serpentini in
Casinca, had established his head-quarters here; De Vaux,
Marb&oelig;uf, and Grand-Maison entered Nebbio to annihilate
him at once. The attack commenced on the 3d of May.
After the battle had lasted three days, Paoli was driven from
his camp at Murati. He now concluded to cross the Golo,
and place that river between himself and the enemy. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
fixed his head-quarters in Rostino, and committed to Gaffori
and Grimaldi the defence of Leuto and Canavaggia, two
points much exposed to the French. Grimaldi betrayed his
trust; and Gaffori, for what reason is uncertain, also failed to
maintain his post.
</p>

<p>
The French, finding the country thus laid open to them,
descended from the heights, and pressed onwards to Ponte
Nuovo, the bridge over the Golo. The main body of the
Corsicans was drawn up on the further bank; above a thousand
of them, along with the company of Prussians, covered
the bridge. The French, whose descent was rapid and unexpected,
drove in the militia, and these, thrown into disorder
and seized with panic, crowded towards the bridge and tried
to cross. The Prussians, however, who had received orders
to bring the fugitives to a halt, fired in the confusion on their
own friends, while the French fired upon their rear, and pushed
forward with the bayonet. The terrible cry of "Treachery!"
was heard. In vain did Gentili attempt to check the disorder;
the rout became general, no position was any longer
tenable, and the militia scattered themselves in headlong flight
among the woods, and over the adjacent country. The unfortunate
battle of Ponte Nuovo was fought on the 9th of May
1769, and on that day the Corsican nation lost its independence.
</p>

<p>
Paoli still made an attempt to prevent the enemy from
entering the province of Casinca. But it was too late. The
whole island, this side the mountains, fell in a few days into
the hands of the French; and that instinctive feeling of being
lost beyond help, which sometimes, in moments of heavy misfortune,
seizes on the minds of a people with overwhelming
force, had taken possession of the Corsicans. They needed a
man like Sampiero. Paoli despaired. He had hastened to
Corte, almost resolved to leave his country. The brave Serpentini
still kept the field in Balagna, with Clemens Paoli at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
his side, who was determined to fight while he drew breath;
and Abatucci still maintained himself beyond the mountains
with a band of bold patriots. All was not yet lost; it was
at least possible to take to the fastnesses and guerilla fighting,
as Renuccio, Vincentello, and Sampiero had done. But the
stubborn hardihood of those men of the iron centuries, was
not and could not be part of Paoli's character; nor could he,
the lawgiver and Pythagoras of his people, lower himself to
range the hills with guerilla bands. Shuddering at the
thought of the blood with which a protracted struggle would
once more deluge his country, he yielded to destiny. His
brother Clemens, Serpentini, Abatucci, and others joined him.
The little company of fugitives hastened to Vivario, then, on
the 11th of June, to the Gulf of Porto Vecchio. There they
embarked, three hundred Corsicans, in an English ship, given
them by Admiral Smittoy, and sailed for Tuscany, from which
they proceeded to England, which has continued ever since
to be the asylum of the fugitives of ruined nationalities, and
has never extended her hospitality to nobler exiles.
</p>

<p>
Not a few, comparing Pasquale Paoli with the old tragic
Corsican heroes, have accused him of weakness. Paoli's own
estimate of himself appears from the following extract from
one of his letters:&mdash;"If Sampiero had lived in my day, the
deliverance of my country would have been of less difficult
accomplishment. What we attempted to do in constituting
the nationality, he would have completed. Corsica needed
at that time a man of bold and enterprising spirit, who should
have spread the terror of his name to the very <span lang='fr_FR'><i>comptoirs</i></span> of
Genoa. France would not have mixed herself in the struggle,
or, if she had, she would have found a more terrible adversary
than any I was able to oppose to her. How often have I
lamented this! Assuredly not courage nor heroic constancy
was wanting in the Corsicans; what they wanted was a leader,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
who could combine and conduct the operations of the war in
the face of experienced generals. We should have shared
the noble work; while I laboured at a code of laws suitable
to the traditions and requirements of the island, his mighty
sword should have had the task of giving strength and security
to the results of our common toil."
</p>

<p>
On the 12th of June 1769, the Corsican people submitted
to French supremacy. But while they were yet in all the
freshness of their sorrow, that centuries of unexampled conflict
should have proved insufficient to rescue their darling
independence; and while the warlike din of the French occupation
still rang from end to end of the island, the Corsican
nation produced, on the 15th of August, in unexhausted
vigour, one hero more, Napoleon Bonaparte, who crushed
Genoa, who enslaved France, and who avenged his country.
So much satisfaction had the Fates reserved for the Corsicans
in their fall; and such was the atoning close they had decreed
to the long tragedy of their history.

</h3>

<p class="center"><span lang='it_IT'>Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' entrate.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dante.</span></p>

<p>
The voyage across to Corsica from Leghorn is very beautiful,
and more interesting than that from Leghorn to Genoa.
We have the picturesque islands of the Tuscan Channel constantly
in view. Behind us lies the Continent, Leghorn with
its forest of masts at the foot of Monte Nero; before us the
lonely ruined tower of Meloria, the little island-cliff, near
which the Pisans under Ugolino suffered that defeat from the
Genoese, which annihilated them as a naval power, and put
their victorious opponents in possession of Corsica; farther
off, the rocky islet of Gorgona; and near it in the west, Capraja.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
We are reminded of Dante's verses, in the canto where
he sings the fate of Ugolino&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"O Pisa! the disgrace of that fair land</p>
<p>
Where Si is spoken: since thy neighbours round</p>
<p>
Take vengeance on thee with a tardy hand,&mdash;</p>
<p>
To dam the mouth of Arno's rolling tide</p>
<p>
Let Capraja and Gorgona raise a mound</p>
<p>
That all may perish in the waters wide."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
The island of Capraja conceals the western extremity of
Corsica; but behind it rise, in far extended outline, the blue
hills of Cape Corso. Farther west, and off Piombino, Elba
heaves its mighty mass of cliff abruptly from the sea, descending
more gently on the side towards the Continent, which we
could faintly descry in the extreme distance. The sea glittered
in the deepest purple, and the sun, sinking behind Capraja,
tinged the sails of passing vessels with a soft rose-red. A
voyage on this basin of the Mediterranean is in reality a
voyage through History itself. In thought, I saw these fair
seas populous with the fleets of the Ph&oelig;nicians and the
Greeks, with the ships of those Phocæans, whose roving
bands were once busy here;&mdash;then Hasdrubal, and the fleets
of the Carthaginians, the Etruscans, the Romans, the Moors,
and the Spaniards, the Pisans, and the Genoese. But still
more impressively are we reminded, by the constant sight
of Corsica and Elba, of the greatest drama the world's
history has presented in modern times&mdash;the drama which
bears the name of Napoleon. Both islands lie in peaceful
vicinity to each other; as near almost as a man's cradle and
his grave&mdash;broad, far-stretching Corsica, which gave Napoleon
birth, and the little Elba, the narrow prison in which they
penned the giant. He burst its rocky bonds as easily as
Samson the withes of the Philistines. Then came his final
fall at Waterloo. After Elba, he was merely an adventurer;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
like Murat, who, leaving Corsica, went, in imitation of Napoleon,
to conquer Naples with a handful of soldiers, and met
a tragic end.
</p>

<p>
The view of Elba throws a Fata Morgana into the excited
fancy, the picture of the island of St. Helena lying far off in
the African seas. Four islands, it seems, strangely influenced
Napoleon's fate&mdash;Corsica, England, Elba, and St. Helena.
He himself was an island in the ocean of universal history&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>unico
nel mondo</i></span>, as the stout Corsican sailor said, beside
whom I stood, gazing on Corsica, and talking of Napoleon.
"<i>Ma Signore</i>," said he, "I know all that better than you,
for I am his countryman;" and now, with the liveliest gesticulations,
he gave me an abridgment of Napoleon's history,
which interested me more in the midst of this scenery than
all the volumes of Thiers. And the nephew?&mdash;"I say the
<span lang='it_IT'><i>Napoleone primo</i></span> was also the <span lang='it_IT'><i>unico</i></span>." The sailor was excellently
versed in the history of his island, and was as well
acquainted with the life of Sampiero as with those of Pasquale
Paoli, Saliceti, and Pozzo di Borgo.
</p>

<p>
Night had fallen meanwhile. The stars shone brilliantly,
and the waves phosphoresced. High over Corsica hung Venus,
the <span lang='it_IT'><i>stellone</i></span> or great star, as the sailors call it, now serving
us to steer by. We sailed between Elba and Capraja, and
close past the rocks of the latter. The historian, Paul Diaconus,
once lived here in banishment, as Seneca did, for eight
long years, in Corsica. Capraja is a naked granite rock. A
Genoese tower stands picturesquely on a cliff, and the only
town in the island, of the same name, seems to hide timidly
behind the gigantic crag which the fortress crowns. The
white walls and white houses, the bare, reddish rocks, and
the wild and desolate seclusion of the place, give the impression
of some lonely city among the cliffs of Syria. Capraja,
which the bold Corsicans made a conquest of in the time of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
Paoli, remained in possession of the Genoese when they sold
Corsica to France; with Genoa it fell to Piedmont.
</p>

<p>
Capraja and its lights had vanished, and we were nearing
the coast of Corsica, on which fires could be seen glimmering
here and there. At length we began to steer for the lighthouse
of Bastia. Presently we were in the harbour. The town encircles
it; to the left the old Genoese fort, to the right the Marina,
high above it in the bend a background of dark hills. A boat
came alongside for the passengers who wished to go ashore.
</p>

<p>
And now I touched, for the first time, the soil of Corsica&mdash;an
island which had attracted me powerfully even in my
childhood, when I saw it on the map. When we first enter
a foreign country, particularly if we enter it during the night,
which veils everything in a mysterious obscurity, a strange
expectancy, a burden of vague suspense, fills the mind, and
our first impressions influence us for days. I confess my
mood was very sombre and uneasy, and I could no longer
resist a certain depression.
</p>

<p>
In the north of Europe we know little more of Corsica than
that Napoleon was born there, that Pasquale Paoli struggled
heroically there for freedom, and that the Corsicans practise
hospitality and the Vendetta, and are the most daring bandits.
The notions I had brought with me were of the gloomiest
cast, and the first incidents thrown in my way were of a kind
thoroughly to justify them.
</p>

<p>
Our boat landed us at the quay, on which the scanty light of
some hand-lanterns showed a group of doganieri and sailors
standing. The boatman sprang on shore. I have hardly ever
seen a man of a more repulsive aspect. He wore the Phrygian
cap of red wool, and had a white cloth tied over one eye; he
was a veritable Charon, and the boundless fury with which he
screamed to the passengers, swearing at them, and examining
the fares by the light of his lantern, gave me at once a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>[134]</a></span>
specimen of the ungovernably passionate temperament of the
Corsicans.
</p>

<p>
The group on the quay were talking eagerly. I heard
them tell how a quarter of an hour ago a Corsican had murdered
his neighbour with three thrusts of a dagger (<span lang='it_IT'><i>ammazzato,
ammazzato</i></span>&mdash;a word never out of my ears in Corsica; <span lang='it_IT'><i>ammazzato
con tre colpi di pugnale</i></span>). "On what account?" "Merely in
the heat of conversation; the sbirri are after him; he will be
in the <span lang='it_IT'><i>macchia</i></span> by this time." The <span lang='it_IT'><i>macchia</i></span> is the bush. I heard
the word <span lang='it_IT'><i>macchia</i></span> in Corsica just as often as <span lang='it_IT'><i>ammazzato</i></span> or
<span lang='it_IT'><i>tumbato</i></span>. He has taken to the <span lang='it_IT'><i>macchia</i></span>, is as much as to say,
he has turned bandit.
</p>

<p>
I was conscious of a slight shudder, and that suspense
which the expectation of strange adventures creates. I was
about to go in search of a locanda&mdash;a young man stepped
up to me and said, in Tuscan, that he would take me to an
inn. I followed the friendly Italian&mdash;a sculptor of Carrara.
No light was shed on the steep and narrow streets of Bastia
but by the stars of heaven. We knocked in vain at four
locandas; none opened. We knocked at the fifth; still no
answer. "We shall not find admittance here," said the Carrarese;
"the landlord's daughter is lying on her bier." We
wandered about the solitary streets for an hour; no one
would listen to our appeals. Is this the famous Corsican
hospitality? I thought; I seem to have come to the City of
the Dead; and to-morrow I will write above the gate of
Bastia: "All hope abandon, ye who enter here!"
</p>

<p>
However, we resolved to make one more trial. Staggering
onwards, we came upon some other passengers in the
same unlucky plight as myself; they were two Frenchmen,
an Italian emigrant, and an English convert. I joined them,
and once more we made the round of the locandas. This
first night's experience was by no means calculated to inspire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
one with a high idea of the commercial activity and culture
of the island; for Bastia is the largest town in Corsica, and
has about fifteen thousand inhabitants. If this was the
stranger's reception in a city, what was he to expect in the
interior of the country?
</p>

<p>
A band of sbirri met us, Corsican gendarmes, dusky-visaged
fellows with black beards, in blue frock-coats, with white
shoulder-knots, and carrying double-barrelled muskets. We
made complaint of our unfortunate case to them. One of
them offered to conduct us to an old soldier who kept a
tavern; there, he thought, we should obtain shelter. He
led us to an old, dilapidated house opposite the fort. We
kept knocking till the soldier-landlord awoke, and showed
himself at the window. At the same moment some one ran
past&mdash;our sbirro after him without saying a word, and both
had vanished in the darkness of the night. What was it?&mdash;what
did this hot pursuit mean? After some time the sbirro
returned; he had imagined the runner was the murderer.
"But he," said the gendarme, "is already in the hills, or
some fisherman has set him over to Elba or Capraja. A short
while ago we shot Arrighi in the mountains, Massoni too, and
Serafino. That was a tough fight with Arrighi: he killed
five of our people."
</p>

<p>
The old soldier came to the door, and led us into a large,
very dirty apartment. We gladly seated ourselves round the
table, and made a hearty supper on excellent Corsican wine,
which has somewhat of the fire of the Spanish, good wheaten
bread, and fresh ewe-milk cheese. A steaming oil-lamp illuminated
this Homeric repast of forlorn travellers; and there
was no lack of good humour to it. Many a health was drained
to the heroes of Corsica, and our soldier-host brought bottle
after bottle from the corner. There were four nations of us
together, Corsican, Frenchman, German, and Lombard. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
once mentioned the name of Louis Bonaparte, and put a
question&mdash;the company was struck dumb, and the faces of
the lively Frenchmen lengthened perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
Gradually the day dawned outside. We left the casa of
the old Corsican, and, wandering to the shore, feasted our
eyes upon the sea, glittering in the mild radiance of the early
morning. The sun was rising fast, and lit up the three
islands visible from Bastia&mdash;Capraja, Elba, and the small
Monte Christo. A fourth island in the same direction is
Pianosa, the ancient Planasia, on which Agrippa Posthumus,
the grandson of Augustus, was strangled by order of Tiberius;
as its name indicates, it is flat, and therefore cannot be distinguished
from our position. The constant view of these
three blue islands, along the edge of the horizon, makes the
walks around Bastia doubly beautiful.
</p>

<p>
I seated myself on the wall of the old fort and looked out
upon the sea, and on the little haven of the town, in which
hardly half a dozen vessels were lying. The picturesque
brown rocks of the shore, the green heights with their dense
olive-groves, little chapels on the strand, isolated gray towers
of the Genoese, the sea, in all the pomp of southern colouring,
the feeling of being lost in a distant island, all this
made, that morning, an indelible impression on my soul.
</p>

<p>
As I left the fort to settle myself in a locanda, now by
daylight, a scene presented itself which was strange, wild,
and bizarre enough. A crowd of people had collected before
the fort, round two mounted carabineers; they were leading
by a long cord a man who kept springing about in a very odd
manner, imitating all the movements of a horse. I saw that
he was a madman, and flattered himself with the belief that
he was a noble charger. None of the bystanders laughed,
though the caprioles of the unfortunate creature were whimsical
enough. All stood grave and silent; and as I saw these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>[137]</a></span>
men gazing so mutely on the wretched spectacle, for the first
time I felt at ease in their island, and said to myself, the
Corsicans are not barbarians. The horsemen at length rode
away with the poor fellow, who trotted like a horse at the end
of his line along the whole street, and seemed perfectly happy.
This way of getting him to his destination by taking advantage
of his fixed idea, appeared to me at once sly and
<i>naïve</i>.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />
<br />

THE CITY OF BASTIA.
</h3>

<p>
The situation of Bastia, though not one of the very finest,
takes one by surprise. The town lies like an amphitheatre
round the little harbour; the sea here does not form a gulf,
but only a landing-place&mdash;a <span lang='it_IT'><i>cala</i></span>. A huge black rock bars
the right side of the harbour, called by the people Leone,
from its resemblance to a lion. Above it stands the gloomy
Genoese fort, called the Donjon. To the left, the quay runs
out in a mole, at the extremity of which is a little lighthouse.
The town ascends in terraces above the harbour; its
houses are high, crowded together, tower-shaped, and have
many balconies: away beyond the town rise the green hills,
with some forsaken cloisters, beautiful olive-groves, and numerous
fruit-gardens of oranges, lemons, and almonds.
</p>

<p>
Bastia has its name from the fortifications or bastions, erected
there by the Genoese. The city is not ancient; neither
Pliny, Strabo, nor Ptolemy, mentions any town as occupying
its site. Formerly the little marina of the neighbouring
town of Cardo stood here. In the year 1383, the Genoese
Governor, Lionello Lomellino, built the Donjon or Castle,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
round which a new quarter of the town arose, which was
called the Terra Nuova, the original lower quarter now receiving
the name of Terra Vecchia. Both quarters still form
two separate cantons. The Genoese now transferred the seat
of their Corsican government to Bastia, and here resided the
Fregosos, Spinolas, Dorias&mdash;within a space of somewhat more
than four hundred years, eleven Dorias ruled in Corsica&mdash;the
Fiescos, Cibbàs, the Guistiniani, Negri, Vivaldi, Fornari, and
many other nobles of celebrated Genoese families. When
Corsica, under French supremacy, was divided into two departments
in 1797, which were named after the rivers Golo and
Liamone, Bastia remained the principal town of the department
of the Golo. In the year 1811, the two parts were again
united, and the smaller Ajaccio became the capital of the country.
Bastia, however, has not yet forgotten that it was once
the capital, though it has now sunk to a sub-prefecture; and
it is, in fact, still, in point of trade, commerce, and intelligence,
the leading city of Corsica. The mutual jealousy of
the Bastinese and the citizens of Ajaccio is almost comical,
and would appear a mere piece of ridiculous provincialism,
did we not know that the division of Corsica into the country
this side and beyond the mountains, is historical, and dates
from a remote antiquity, while the character of the inhabitants
of the two halves is also entirely different. Beyond the
mountains which divide Corsica from north to south, the
people are much ruder and wilder, and all go armed; this
side the mountains there is much more culture, the land is
better tilled, and the manners of the population are gentler.
</p>

<p>
The Terra Vecchia of Bastia has nowadays, properly
speaking, become the Terra Nuova, for it contains the best
streets. The stateliest of them is the Via Traversa, a street
of six and seven-storied houses, bending towards the sea; it
is only a few years old, and still continues to receive additions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>[139]</a></span>
Its situation reminded me of the finest street I have ever
seen, the Strada Balbi and Nuova in Genoa. But the houses,
though of palatial magnitude, have nothing to boast of in the
way of artistic decoration, or noble material. The very finest
kinds of stone exist in Corsica in an abundance scarcely credible&mdash;marble,
porphyry, serpentine, alabaster, and the costliest
granite; and yet they are hardly ever used. Nature is everywhere
here abandoned to neglect; she is a beautiful princess
under a spell.
</p>

<p>
They are building a Palace of Justice in the Via Traversa
at present, for the porticos of which I saw them cutting pillars
in the marble quarries of Corte. Elsewhere, I looked in vain
for marble ornament; and yet&mdash;who would believe it?&mdash;the
whole town of Bastia is paved with marble&mdash;a reddish sort,
quarried in Brando. I do not know whether it is true that
Bastia has the best pavement in the world; I have heard it
said.
</p>

<p>
Despite its length and breadth, the Via Traversa is the
least lively of all the streets of Bastia. All the bustle and
business are concentrated in the Place Favalelli, on the quay,
and in the Terra Nuova, round the Fort. In the evening,
the fashionable world promenades in the large Place San
Nicolao, by the sea, where are the offices of the sub-prefecture,
and the highest court of justice.
</p>

<p>
Not a single building of any architectural pretensions fetters
the eye of the stranger here; he must find his entertainment
in the beautiful walks along the shore, and on the olive-shaded
hills. Some of the churches are large, and richly
decorated; but they are clumsy in exterior, and possess no
particular artistic attraction. The Cathedral, in which a
great many Genoese seigniors lie entombed, stands in the
Terra Nuova; in the Terra Vecchia is the large Church of
St. John the Baptist. I mention it merely on account of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140'>[140]</a></span>
Marb&oelig;uf's tomb. Marb&oelig;uf governed Corsica for sixteen
years; he was the friend of Carlo Bonaparte, once so warm an
adherent of Paoli; and it was he who opened the career of
Napoleon, for he procured him his place in the military school
of Brienne. His tomb in the church referred to bears no
inscription; the monument and epitaph, as they originally
existed, were destroyed in the Paolistic revolution against
France. The Corsican patriots at that time wrote on the
tomb of Marb&oelig;uf: "The monument which disgraceful falsehood
and venal treachery dedicated to the tyrant of groaning
Corsica, the true liberty and liberated truth of all rejoicing
Corsica have now destroyed." After Napoleon had become
Emperor, Madame Letitia wished to procure the widow of
Marb&oelig;uf a high position among the ladies of honour in the
imperial court; but Napoleon luckily avoided such gross
want of tact, perceiving how unsuitable it was to offer Mme.
Marb&oelig;uf a subordinate charge in the very family which owed
so much to the patronage of her husband. He granted Marb&oelig;uf's
son a yearly pension of ten thousand francs; but the
young general fell at the head of his regiment in Russia.
The little theatre in Bastia is a memorial of Marb&oelig;uf; it was
built at his expense.
</p>

<p>
Another Frenchman of note lies buried in the Church of
St. John&mdash;Count Boissieux, who died in the year 1738. He
was a nephew of the celebrated Villars; but as a military
man, had no success.
</p>

<p>
The busy stir in the markets, and the life about the port,
were what interested me by far the most in Bastia.
</p>

<p>
There was the fish-market, for example. I never omitted
paying a morning visit to the new arrivals from the sea; and
when the fishermen had caught anything unusual, they
showed it me in a friendly way, and would say&mdash;"This,
Signore, is a <span lang='it_IT'><i>murena</i></span>, and this is the <span lang='it_IT'><i>razza</i></span>, and these are the
<span lang='it_IT'><i><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
pesce spada</i></span>, and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>pesce prete</i></span>, and the beautiful red <span lang='it_IT'><i>triglia</i></span>,
and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>capone</i></span>, and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>grongo</i></span>." Yonder in the corner, as
below caste, sit the pond-fishers: along the east coast of Corsica
are large ponds, separated from the sea by narrow
tongues of land, but connected with it by inlets. The fishermen
take large and well-flavoured fish in these, with nets of
twisted rushes, eels in abundance&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>mugini</i></span>, <span lang='it_IT'><i>ragni</i></span>, and <span lang='it_IT'><i>soglie</i></span>.
The prettiest of all these fish is the murena; it is like a snake,
and as if formed of the finest porphyry. It pursues the
lobster (<span lang='it_IT'><i>legusta</i></span>), into which it sucks itself; the legusta devours
the scorpena, and the scorpena again the murena. So
here we have another version of the clever old riddle of the
wolf, the lamb, and the cabbage, and how they were to be
carried across a river. I am too little of a diplomatist to
settle this intricate cross-war of the three fishes; they are
often caught all three in the same net. Tunny and anchovies
are caught in great quantities in the gulfs of Corsica,
especially about Ajaccio and Bonifazio. The Romans had
no liking for Corsican slaves&mdash;they were apt to be refractory;
but the Corsican fish figured on the tables of the great, and
even Juvenal has a word of commendation for them.
</p>

<p>
The market in the Place Favalelli presents in the morning
a fresh, lively, motley picture. There sit the peasant
women with their vegetables, and the fruit-girls with their
baskets, out of which the beautiful fruits of the south look
laughingly. One only needs to visit this market to learn
what the soil of Corsica can produce in the matter of fruit;
here are pears and apples, peaches and apricots, plums of
every sort; there green almonds, oranges and lemons, pomegranates;
near them potatoes, then bouquets of flowers, yonder
green and blue figs, and the inevitable <span lang='it_IT'><i>pomi d'oro</i></span>
(<span lang='fr_FR'><i>pommes d'amour</i></span>); yonder again the most delicious melons,
at a soldo or penny each; and in August come the muscatel-grapes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
of Cape Corso. In the early morning, the women
and girls come down from the villages round Bastia, and
bring their fruit into the town. Many graceful forms are to
be seen among them. I was wandering one evening along
the shore towards Pietra Nera, and met a young girl, who,
with her empty fruit-basket on her head, was returning to
her village. "<span lang='it_IT'><i>Buona sera&mdash;Evviva, Siore.</i></span>" We were soon in
lively conversation. This young Corsican girl related to me
the history of her heart with the utmost simplicity;&mdash;how
her mother was compelling her to marry a young man she
did not like. "Why do you not like him?" "Because his
<span lang='it_IT'><i>ingegno</i></span> does not please me, <span lang='it_IT'><i>ah madonna</i></span>!" "Is he jealous?"
"<span lang='it_IT'><i>Come un diavolo, ah madonna!</i></span> I nearly ran off to Ajaccio
already." As we walked along talking, a Corsican came up,
who, with a pitcher in his hand, was going to a neighbouring
spring. "If you wish a draught of water," said he, "wait a
little till I come down, and you, Paolina, come to me by and
bye: I have something to say to you about your marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Look you, sir," said the girl, "that is one of our relations;
they are all fond of me, and when they meet me, they
do not pass me with a good evening; and none of them will
hear of my marrying Antonio." By this time we were approaching
her house. Paolina suddenly turned to me, and
said with great seriousness&mdash;"Siore, you must turn back now;
if I go into my village along with you, the people will talk ill
of me (<span lang='it_IT'><i>faranne mal grido</i></span>). But come to-morrow, if you like,
and be my mother's guest, and after that we will send you to
our relations, for we have friends enough all over Cape
Corso." I returned towards the city, and in presence of the
unspeakable beauty of the sea, and the silent calm of the
hills, on which the goat-herds had begun to kindle their fires,
my mood became quite Homeric, and I could not help thinking
of the old hospitable Phæacians and the fair Nausicaa.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The head-dress of the Corsican women is the mandile, a
handkerchief of any colour, which covers the forehead, and
smoothly enwrapping the head, is wound about the knot of
hair behind; so that the hair is thus concealed. The mandile
is in use all over Corsica; it looks Moorish and Oriental, and
is of high antiquity, for there are female figures on Etrurian
vases represented with the mandile. It is very becoming on
young girls, less so on elderly women; it makes the latter look
like the Jewish females. The men wear the pointed brown
or red baretto, the ancient Phrygian cap, which Paris, son of
Priam, wore. The marbles representing this Trojan prince
give him the baretto; the Persian Mithras also wears it, as I
have observed in the common symbolic group where Mithras
is seen slaying the bull. Among the Romans, the Phrygian
cap was the usual symbol of the barbarians; the well-known
Dacian captives of the triumphal arch of Trajan which now
stand on the arch of Constantine, wear it; so do other barbarian
kings and slaves, Sarmatian and Asiatic, whom we find
represented in triumphal processions. The Venetian Doge
also wore a Phrygian cap as a symbol of his dignity.
</p>

<p>
The women in Corsica carry all their burdens on their
head, and the weight they will thus carry is hardly credible;
laden in this way, they often hold the spindle in their hand,
and spin as they walk along. It is a picturesque sight, the
women of Bastia carrying their two-handled brazen water-pitchers
on their head; these bear a great resemblance to the
antique consecrated vases of the temples; I never saw them
except in Bastia; beyond the mountains they fetch their
water in stone pitchers, of rude but still slightly Etruscan
form.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see yonder woman with the water-pitcher on her
head?" "Yes, what is remarkable about her?" "She might
perhaps have been this day a princess of Sweden, and the consort
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
of a king." "<span lang='it_IT'><i>Madre di Dio!</i></span>" "Do you see yonder village
on the hillside? that is Cardo. The common soldier Bernadotte
one day fell in love with a peasant girl of Cardo. The
parents would not let the poor fellow court her. The <span lang='it_IT'><i>povero
diavolo</i></span>, however, one day became a king, and if he had married
that girl, she would have been a queen; and now her
daughter there, with the water on her head, goes about and
torments herself that she is not Princess of Sweden." It was
on the highway from Bastia to San Fiorenzo that Bernadotte
worked as a common soldier on the roads. At Ponte d'Ucciani
he was made corporal, and very proud he was of his advancement.
He now watched as superintendent over the workmen;
afterwards he copied the rolls for Imbrico, clerk of court at
Bastia. There is still a great mass of them in his handwriting
among the archives at Paris.
</p>

<p>
It was on the Bridge of Golo, some miles from Bastia, that
Massena was made corporal. Yes, Corsica is a wonderful
island. Many a one has wandered among the lonely hills here,
who never dreamed that he was yet to wear a crown. Pope
Formosus made a beginning in the ninth century&mdash;he was a
native of the Corsican village of Vivario; then a Corsican of
Bastia followed him in the sixteenth century, Lazaro, the renegade,
and Dey of Algiers; in the time of Napoleon, a Corsican
woman was first Sultaness of Morocco; and Napoleon
himself was first Emperor of Europe.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />
<br />

ENVIRONS OF BASTIA.
</h3>

<p>
How beautiful the walks are here in the morning, or at
moon-rise! A few steps and you are by the sea, or among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
the hills, and there or here, you are rid of the world,
and deep in the refreshing solitude of nature. Dense olive-groves
fringe some parts of the shore. I often lay among
these, beside a little retired tomb, with a Moorish cupola, the
burial-vault of some family, and looked out upon the sea, and
the three islands on its farthest verge. It was a spot of delicious
calm; the air was so sunny, so soothingly still, and
wherever the eye rested, holiday repose and hermit loneliness,
a waste of brown rocks on the strand, covered with prickly
cactus, solitary watch-towers, not a human being, not a bird
upon the water; and to the right and left, warm and sunny,
the high blue hills.
</p>

<p>
I mounted the heights immediately above Bastia. From
these there is a very pleasant view of the town, the sea, and
the islands. Vineyards, olive-gardens, orange-trees, little
villas of forms the most bizarre; here and there a fan-palm,
tombs among cypresses, ruins quite choked in ivy, are scattered
on every side. The paths are difficult and toilsome; you
wander over loose stones, over low walls, between bramble-hedges,
among trailing ivy, and a wild and rank profusion of
thistles. The view of the shore to the south of Bastia surprised
me. The hills there, like almost all the Corsican hills,
of a fine pyramidal form, retire farther from the shore, and
slope gently down to a smiling plain. In this level lies the
great pond of Biguglia, encircled with reeds, dead and still,
hardly a fishing-skiff cutting its smooth waters. The sun
was just sinking as I enjoyed this sight. The lake gleamed
rosy red, the hills the same, and the sea was full of the evening
splendour, with a single ship gliding across. The repose
of a grand natural scene calms the soul. To the left I saw
the cloister of San Antonio, among olive-trees and cypresses;
two priests sat in the porch, and some black-veiled nuns were
coming out of the church. I remembered a picture I had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
once seen of evening in Sicily, and found it here reproduced.
</p>

<p>
Descending to the highway, I came to a road which leads
to Cervione; herdsmen were driving home their goats, riders
on little red horses flew past me, wild fellows with bronzed
faces, all with the Phrygian cap on their heads, the dark
brown Corsican jacket of sheeps'-wool hanging loosely about
them, double-barrels slung upon their backs. I often saw
them riding double on their little animals: frequently a man
with a woman behind him, and if the sun was hot they were
always holding a large umbrella above them. The parasol is
here indispensable; I frequently saw both men and women&mdash;the
women clothed, the men naked&mdash;sitting at their ease in the
shallow water near the shore, and holding the broad parasol
above their heads, evidently enjoying themselves mightily.
The women here ride like the men, and manage their horses
very cleverly. The men have always the zucca or round
gourd-bottle slung behind them; often, too, a pouch of goatskin,
zaino, and round their middle is girt the carchera&mdash;a
leathern belt which holds their cartridges.
</p>

<p>
Before me walked numbers of men returning from labour in
the fields; I joined them, and learned that they were not
Corsicans, but Italians from the Continent. More than five
thousand labourers come every year from Italy, particularly
from Leghorn, and the country about Lucca and Piombino, to
execute the field labour for the lazy Corsicans. Up to the
present day the Corsicans have maintained a well-founded reputation
for indolence, and in this they are thoroughly unlike
other brave mountaineers, as, for example, the Samnites. All
these foreign workmen go under the common appellation of
Lucchesi. I have been able personally to convince myself
with what utter contempt these poor and industrious men are
looked on by the Corsicans, because they have left their home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
to work in the sweat of their brow, exposed to a pestilential
atmosphere, in order to bring their little earnings to their
families. I frequently heard the word "Lucchese" used as
an opprobrious epithet; and particularly among the mountains
of the interior is all field-work held in detestation as
unworthy of a freeman; the Corsican is a herdsman, as his
forefathers have been from time immemorial; he contents
himself with his goats, his repast of chestnuts, a fresh draught
from the spring, and what his gun can bring down.
</p>

<p>
I learned at the same time that there were at present in Corsica
great numbers of Italian democrats, who had fled to the
island on the failure of the revolution. There were during the
summer about one hundred and fifty of them scattered over
the island, men of all ranks; most of them lived in Bastia.
I had opportunities of becoming acquainted with the most respectable
of these refugees, and of accompanying them on their
walks. They formed a company as motley as political Italy
herself&mdash;Lombards, Venetians, Neapolitans, Romans, and
Florentines. I experienced the fact that in a country where
there is little cultivated society, Italians and Germans immediately
exercise a mutual attraction, and have on neutral
ground a brotherly feeling for each other. There was a universality
in the events and results of the year 1848, which
broke down many limitations, and produced certain views of
life and certain theories within which individuals, to whatever
nationalities they may belong, feel themselves related and at
home. I found among these exiles in Corsica men and youths
of all classes, such as are to be met with in similar companies
at home&mdash;enthusiastic and sanguine spirits; others again, men
of practical experience, sound principle, and clear intellect.
</p>

<p>
The world is at present full of the political fugitives of
European nations; they are especially scattered over the
islands, which have long been, and are in their nature destined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'>[148]</a></span>
to be, used as asylums. There are many exiles in the
Ionian Islands and in the islands of Greece, many in Sardinia
and Corsica, many in the islands of the English Channel, most
of all in Britain. It is a general and European lot which
has fallen to these exiles&mdash;only the locality is different; and
banishment itself, as a result of political crime, or political
misfortune, is as old as the history of organized states. I remembered
well how in former times the islands of the Mediterranean&mdash;Samos,
Delos, Ægina, Corcyra, Lesbos, Rhodes&mdash;sheltered
the political refugees of Greece, as often as revolution
drove them from Athens or Thebes, or Corinth or Sparta.
I thought of the many exiles whom Rome sent to the islands
in the time of the Emperors, as Agrippa Posthumus to Planasia,
the philosopher Seneca to Corsica itself. Corsica particularly
has been at all times not only a place of refuge, but
a place of banishment; in the strictest sense of the word,
therefore, an island of <i>bandits</i>, and this it still is at the present
day. The avengers of blood wander homeless in the
mountains, the political fugitives dwell homeless in the towns.
The ban of outlawry rests upon both, and if the law could
reach them, their fate would be the prison, if not death.
</p>

<p>
Corsica, in receiving these poor banished Italians, does
more than simply practise her cherished religion of hospitality,
she discharges a debt of gratitude. For in earlier centuries
Corsican refugees found the most hospitable reception in all
parts of Italy; and banished Corsicans were to be met with
in Rome, in Florence, in Venice, and in Naples. The French
government has hitherto treated its guests on the island with
liberality and tolerance. The remote seclusion of their position
compels these exiles to a life of contemplative quiet; and
they are, perhaps precisely on this account, more fortunate
than their brethren in misfortune in Jersey or London.

<p>
I was told in a bookseller's shop into which I had gone in
search of a Geography of the island, that there was one then
in the press, and that its author was Francesco Marmocchi, a
banished Florentine. I immediately sought this gentleman
out, and made in him one of the most valuable of all my Italian
acquaintances. I found a man of prepossessing exterior, considerably
above thirty, in a little room, buried among books.
Possibly the rooms of most political exiles do not present such
a peaceful aspect. On the bookshelves were the best classical
authors; and my eye lighted with no small pleasure on Humboldt's
<i>Cosmos</i>; on the walls were copperplate views of
Florence, and an admirable copy of a Perugino; all this told
not only of the seclusion of a scholar, but of that of a highly
cultivated Florentine. There are perhaps few greater contrasts
than that between Florence and Corsica, and my own
feelings were at first certainly peculiar, when, after six weeks'
stay in Florence, I suddenly exchanged the Madonnas of
Raphael for the Corsican banditti; but it is always to be remembered
that Corsica is an island of enchanting beauty; and
though banishment to paradise itself would remain banishment,
still the student of nature may at least, as Seneca
did, console himself here with the grandeur and beauty
around him, in undisturbed tranquillity. All that Seneca
wrote from his Corsican exile to his mother on the consolation
to be found in contemplating nature, and in science,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>[150]</a></span>
Francesco Marmocchi may fully apply to himself. This
former Florentine professor seemed to me, in his dignified
retirement and learned leisure, the happiest of all exiles.
</p>

<p>
Francesco Marmocchi was minister of Tuscany during the
revolution, along with Guerazzi; he was afterwards secretary
to the ministry: more fortunate than his political friend, he
escaped from Florence to Rome, and then from Rome to Corsica,
where he had already lived three years. His unwearied
activity, and the stoical serenity with which he bears his exile,
attest the manly vigour of his character. Francesco Marmocchi
is one of the most esteemed and talented Italian geographers.
Besides his great work, a Universal Geography in
six quarto volumes, a new edition of which is at present publishing,
he has written a special Geography of Italy in two
volumes; a Historical Geography of the Ancient World, of
the Middle Ages, and of Modern Times; a Natural History
of Italy, and other works. I found him correcting the proof-sheets
of his little Geography of Corsica, an excellent hand-book,
which he has unfortunately been obliged to write in
French. This book is published in Bastia, by Fabiani; it
has afforded me some valuable information about Corsica.
</p>

<p>
One morning before sunrise we went into the hills round
Cardo, and here, amid the fresh bloom of the Corsican landscape,
if the reader will suppose himself in our company, we
shall take the geographer himself for guide and interpreter,
and hear what he has to say upon the island. I give almost
the very words of his Geography.
</p>

<p>
Corsica owes her existence to successive conglobations of upheaved
masses; during an extended period she has had three
great volcanic processes, to which the bizarre and abrupt contours
of her landscape are to be ascribed. These three upheavals
may be readily distinguished. The first masses of
Corsican land that rose were those that occupy the entire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>[151]</a></span>
south-western side. This earliest upheaval took place in a
direction from north-west to south-east; its marks are the two
great ribs of mountain which run parallel, from north-east to
south-west, down towards the sea, and form the most important
promontories of the west coast. The axis of Corsica at
that time must therefore have been different from its later one;
and the islands in the channel of Bonifazio, as well as a part
of the north-east of Sardinia, then stood in connexion with
Corsica. The material of this first upheaval is mostly granite;
consequently at the period of this primeval revolution
there was no life of any sort on the island.
</p>

<p>
The direction of the second upheaval was from south-west to
north-east, and the material here again consists largely of granitoids.
But as we advance to the north-east, we find the granite
gradually giving way to the ophiolitic (<i>ophiolitisch</i>) earth
system. The second upheaval is, however, hardly discernible.
It is clear that it destroyed most of the northern ridge of the
first; but Corsican geology has preserved very few traces of it.
</p>

<p>
The undoubted effect of the third and last upheaval was
the almost entire destruction of the southern portion of the
first; and it was at this time the island received its present
form. It occurred in a direction from north to south. So long
as the masses of this last eruption have not come in contact
with the masses of previous upheavals, their direction remains
regular, as is shown by the mountain-chain of Cape Corso.
But it had to burst its way through the towering masses of
the southern ridge with a fearful shock; it broke them up,
altering its direction, and sustaining interruption at many
points, as is shown by the openings of the valleys, which
lead from the interior to the plain of the east coast, and have
become the beds of the streams that flow into the sea on this
side&mdash;the Bevinco, the Golo, the Tavignano, the Fiumorbo,
and others.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The rock strata of this third upheaval are primitive ophiolitic
and primitive calcareous, covered at various places by
secondary formations.
</p>

<p>
The primitive masses, which occupy, therefore, the south
and west of the island, consist almost entirely of granite. At
their extremities they include some layers of gneiss and slate.
The granite is almost everywhere covered&mdash;a clear proof that
it was elevated at a period antecedent to that during which
the covering masses were forming in the bosom of the ocean,
to be deposited in horizontal strata on the crystalline granite
masses. Strata of porphyry and eurite pierce the granite; a
decided porphyritic formation crowns Mounts Cinto, Vagliorba,
and Perturato, the highest summits of Niolo, overlying the
granite. From two to three feet of mighty greenstone penetrate
these porphyritic rocks.
</p>

<p>
The intermediary masses occupy the whole of Cape Corso,
and the east of the island. They consist of bluish gray limestone,
huge masses of talc, stalactites, serpentine, euphotides,
quartz, felspar, and porphyries.
</p>

<p>
The tertiary formations appear only in isolated strips, as at
San Fiorenzo, Volpajola, Aleria, and Bonifazio. They exhibit
numerous fossils of marine animals of subordinate species&mdash;sea-urchins,
polypi, and many other petrifactions in the limestone
layers.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the plains of the east coast of Corsica, as the
plains Biguglia, Mariana, and Aleria, they are diluvial deposits
of the period when the floods destroyed vast numbers of
animal species. Among the diluvial fossils in the neighbourhood
of Bastia, the head of a lagomys has been found&mdash;a small
hare without tail, existing at the present day in Siberia.
</p>

<p>
There is no volcano in Corsica; but traces of extinct volcanoes
may be seen near Porto Vecchio, Aleria, Balistro,
San Manza, and at other points.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It seems almost incredible that an island like Corsica, so
close to Sardinia and Tuscany, and, above all, so near the iron
island of Elba, should be so poor in metals as it really is.
Numerous indications of metallic veins are, it is true, to be
found everywhere, now of iron or copper, now of lead, antimony,
manganese, quicksilver, cobalt, gold and silver, but
these, as the engineer Gueymard has shown in his work on
the geology and mineralogy of Corsica, are illusory.
</p>

<p>
The only metal mines of importance that can be wrought,
are, at present, the iron mines of Olmeta and Farinole in Cape
Corso, an iron mine near Venzolasca, the copper mine of
Linguizzetta, the antimony mine of Ersa in Cape Corso, and
the manganese mine near Alesani.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Corsica is an inexhaustible treasury of
the rarest and most valuable stones, an elysium of the geologist.
But they lie unused; no one digs the treasure.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It may not be out of place here to give a detail of these
beautiful stones, arranged in the usual geological order.

A SECOND LESSON, THE VEGETATION OF CORSICA.
</h3>

<p>
It was an instructive lesson that Francesco Marmocchi,
<i>quondam</i> professor of natural history, <i>quondam</i> minister of
Tuscany, now Fuoruscito, and poor solitary student, gave me,
that rosiest of all morning hours as we stood high up on the
green Mount Cardo, the fair Mediterranean extended at our
feet, exactly of such a colour as Dante has described: <span lang='it_IT'><i>color
del Oriental zaffiro</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
"See," said Marmocchi, "where the blue outline shows
itself, yonder is the beautiful Toscana."
</p>

<p>
Ah, I see Toscana well; plainly I see fair Florence, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>[155]</a></span>
the halls where the statues of the great Tuscans stand,
Giotto, Orcagna, Nicola Pisano, Dante, Petrarca, Boccacio,
Macchiavelli, Galilei, and the godlike Michael Angelo; three
thousand Croats&mdash;I can see them&mdash;are parading there among
the statues; the air is so clear, you can see and hear everything:
listen, Francesco, to the verses the marble Michael
Angelo is now addressing to Dante:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Dear is to me my sleep, and that I am of stone;</p>
<p>
While this wo lasts, this ignominy deep,</p>
<p>
To see nought, and to hear nought, that alone</p>
<p>
Is well; then wake me not, speak low, and weep!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
But do you see how this dry brown rock has decorated himself
over and over with flowers? On his head he wears a
glorious plume of myrtles, white with blossom, and his breast
is wound with a threefold cord of honour; with ivy, bramble,
and the white wild vine&mdash;the clematis. There are no fairer
garlands than those wreaths of clematis with their clusters of
white blossom, and delicate leaves; the ancients loved them
well, and willingly in lyric hours wore them round their heads.
</p>

<p>
Within the compass of a few paces, what a profusion of
different plants! Here are rosemary and cytisus, there wild
asparagus, beside it a tall bush of lilac-blossomed erica; here
again the poisonous euphorbia, which sheds a milk-white juice
when you break it; and here the sympathetic helianthemum,
with its beautiful golden flowers, which one by one all fall off
when you have broken a single twig; yonder, outlandish and
bizarre, stands the prickly cactus, like a Moorish heathen, near
it the wild olive shrub, the cork-oak, the lentiscus, the wild
fig, and at their roots bloom the well-known children of our
northern homes&mdash;the scabiosa, the geranium, and the mallow.
How exquisite, pungent, invigorating are the perfumes that
all this blooming vegetation breathes forth; the rue there, the
lavender, the mint, and all those labiatae. Did not Napoleon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
say on St. Helena, as his mournful thoughts turned again to
his native island: "All was better there, to the very smell of
the soil; with shut eyes I should know Corsica from its fragrance
alone."
</p>

<p>
Let us hear something from Marmocchi now, on the botany
of Corsica in general.
</p>

<p>
Corsica is the most central region of the great plant-system
of the Mediterranean&mdash;a system characterized by a profusion
of fragrant Labiatæ and graceful Caryophylleæ. These
plants cover all parts of the island, and at all seasons of the
year fill the air with their perfume.
</p>

<p>
On account of the central position of Corsica, its vegetation
connects itself with that of all the other provinces of the
immense botanic region referred to; through Cape Corso it is
connected with the plants of Liguria, through the east coast
with those of Tuscany and Rome, through the west and
south coasts with the botany of Provence, Spain, Barbary,
Sicily, and the East; and finally, through the mountainous
and lofty region of the interior, with that of the Alps and
Pyrenees. What a wondrous opulence, and astonishing variety,
therefore, in the Corsican vegetation!&mdash;a variety and
opulence that infinitely heightens the beauty of the various
regions of this island, already rendered so picturesque by their
geological configuration.
</p>

<p>
Some of the forests, on the slopes of the mountains, are as
beautiful as the finest in Europe&mdash;particularly those of Aitone
and Vizzavona; besides, many provinces of Corsica are covered
with boundless groves of chestnuts, the trees in which are as
large and fruitful as the finest on the Apennines or Etna.
Plantations of olives, from their extent entitled to be called
forests, clothe the eminences, and line the valleys that run
towards the sea, or lie open to its influences. Even on the
rude sides of the higher mountains, the grape-vine twines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
itself round the orchard-fences, and spreads to the view its
green leaves and purple fruit. Fertile plains, golden with
rich harvests, stretch along the coasts of the island, and wheat
and rye enliven the hillsides, here and there, with their fresh
green, which contrasts agreeably with the dark verdure of
the copsewoods, and the cold tones of the naked rock.
</p>

<p>
The maple and walnut, like the chestnut, thrive in the valleys
and on the heights of Corsica; the cypress and the sea-pine
prefer the less elevated regions; the forests are full of
cork oaks and evergreen oaks; the arbutus and the myrtle
grow to the size of trees. Pomaceous trees, but particularly
the wild olive, cover wide tracts on the heights. The evergreen
thorn, and the broom of Spain and Corsica, mingle
with heaths in manifold variety, and all equally beautiful;
among these may be distinguished the <span lang='la'><i>erica arborea</i></span>, which
frequently reaches an uncommon height.
</p>

<p>
On the tracts which are watered by the overflowing of
streams and brooks, grow the broom of Etna, with its beautiful
golden-yellow blossoms, the cisti, the lentisks, the terebinths,
everywhere where the hand of man has not touched
the soil. Further down, towards the plains, there is no
hollow or valley which is not hung with the rhododendron,
whose twigs, towards the sea-coast, entwine with those of the
tamarisk.
</p>

<p>
The fan-palm grows on the rocks by the shore, and the
date-palm, probably introduced from Africa, on the most
sheltered spots of the coast. The <span lang='la'><i>cactus opuntia</i></span> and the
American agave grow everywhere in places that are warm,
rocky, and dry.
</p>

<p>
What shall I say of the magnificent cotyledons, of the
beautiful papilionaceous plants, of the large verbasceæ, the
glorious purple digitalis, that deck the mountains of the
island? And of the mallows, the orchises, the liliaceæ, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
solanaceæ, the centaurea, and the thistles&mdash;plants which so
beautifully adorn the sunny and exposed, or cool and shady
regions where their natural affinities allow them to grow?
</p>

<p>
The fig, the pomegranate, the vine, yield good fruit in
Corsica, even where the husbandman neglects them, and the
climate and soil of the coasts of this beautiful island are so
favourable to the lemon and the orange, and the other trees
of the same family, that they literally form forests.
</p>

<p>
The almond, the cherry, the plum, the apple-tree, the pear
tree, the peach, and the apricot, and, in general, all the fruit
trees of Europe, are here common. In the hottest districts of
the island, the fruits of the St. John's bread-tree, the medlar
of various kinds, the jujube tree, reach complete ripeness.
</p>

<p>
The hand of man, if man were willing, might introduce in
the proper quarters, and without much trouble, the sugar-cane,
the cotton plant, tobacco, the pine-apple, madder, and
even indigo, with success. In a word, Corsica might become
for France a little Indies in the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
This singularly magnificent vegetation of the island is
favoured by the climate. The Corsican climate has three
distinct zones of temperature, graduated according to the
elevation of the soil. The first climatic zone rises from the
level of the sea to the height of five hundred and eighty
metres (1903 English feet); the second, from the line of the
former, to the height of one thousand nine hundred and fifty
metres (6398 feet); the third, to the summit of the mountains.
</p>

<p>
The first zone or region of the coast is warm, like the
parallel tracts of Italy and Spain. Its year has properly only
two seasons, spring and summer; seldom does the thermometer
fall 1° or 2° below zero of Reaumur (27° or 28° Fah.); and
when it does so, it is only for a few hours. All along the coast,
the sun is warm even in January, the nights and the shade cool,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
and this at all seasons of the year. The sky is clouded only
during short intervals; the heavy sirocco alone, from the
south-east, brings lingering vapours, till the vehement south-west&mdash;the
libeccio, again dispels them. The moderate cold of
January is rapidly followed by a dog-day heat of eight months,
and the temperature mounts from 8° to 18° of Reaumur (50°
to 72° Fah.), and even to 26° (90° Fah.) in the shade. It is,
then, a misfortune for the vegetation, if no rain falls in March
or April&mdash;and this misfortune occurs often; but the Corsican
trees have, in general, hard and tough leaves, which withstand
the drought, as the oleander, the myrtle, the cistus, the
lentiscus, the wild olive. In Corsica, as in all warm climates,
the moist and shady regions are almost pestilential; you
cannot walk in these in the evening without contracting long
and severe fever, which, unless an entire change of air intervene,
will end in dropsy and death.
</p>

<p>
The second climatic zone resembles the climate of France,
more especially that of Burgundy, Morvan, and Bretagne. Here
the snow, which generally appears in November, lasts sometimes
twenty days; but, singularly enough, up to a height of
one thousand one hundred and sixty metres (3706 feet), it
does no harm to the olive; but, on the contrary, increases
its fruitfulness. The chestnut seems to be the tree proper to
this zone, as it ceases at the elevation of one thousand nine
hundred and fifty metres (6398 feet), giving place to the evergreen
oaks, firs, beeches, box-trees, and junipers. In this
climate, too, live most of the Corsicans in scattered villages
on mountain slopes and in valleys.
</p>

<p>
The third climate is cold and stormy, like that of Norway,
during eight months of the year. The only inhabited parts
are the district of Niolo, and the two forts of Vivario and
Vizzavona. Above these inhabited spots no vegetation meets
the eye but the firs that hang on the gray rocks. There the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
vulture and the wild-sheep dwell, and there are the storehouse
and cradle of the many streams that pour downwards
into the valleys and plains.
</p>

<p>
Corsica may therefore be considered as a pyramid with
three horizontal gradations, the lowermost of which is warm
and moist, the uppermost cold and dry, while the intermediate
shares the qualities of both.

LEARNED MEN.
</h3>

<p>
If we reflect on the number of great men that Corsica has
produced within the space of scarcely a hundred years, we
cannot but be astonished that an island so small, and so thinly
populated, is yet so rich in extraordinary minds. Its statesmen
and generals are of European note; and if it has not
been so fruitful in scientific talent, this is a consequence of
its nature as an island, and of its iron history.
</p>

<p>
But even scientific talent of no mean grade has of late
years been active in Corsica, and names like Pompei, Renucci,
Savelli, Rafaelli, Giubeja, Salvatore Viali, Caraffa, Gregori,
are an honour to the island. The men of most powerful
intellect among these belong to the legal profession. They
have distinguished themselves particularly in jurisprudence,
and as historians of their own country.
</p>

<p>
A man the most remarkable and meritorious of them all,
and whose memory will not soon die in Corsica, was Giovanni
Carlo Gregori. He was born in Bastia in 1797, and belonged
to one of the best families in the island. Devoting
himself to the study of law, he first became auditor in Bastia,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
afterwards judge in Ajaccio, councillor at the king's court in
Riom, then at the appeal court in Lyons, where he was also
active as president of the Academy of Sciences, and where,
on the 27th of May 1852, he died. He has written important
treatises on Roman jurisprudence; but he had a patriotic
passion for the history of his native country, and with this he
was unceasingly occupied. He had resolved to write a history
of Corsica, had made detailed researches, and collected
the necessary materials for it; but death overtook him, and
the loss of his work to Corsica cannot be sufficiently lamented.
Nevertheless, Gregori has done important service to his native
country: he edited the new edition of the national historian
Filippini, a continuation of whose work it had been his purpose
to write; he also edited the Corsican history of Petrus
Cyrnæus; and in the year 1843 he published a highly important
work&mdash;the Statutes of Corsica. In his earlier years
he had written a Corsican tragedy, with Sampiero for a hero,
which I have not seen.
</p>

<p>
Gregori maintained a most lively literary connexion with
Italy and Germany. His acquirements were unusually extended,
and his activity of the genuine Corsican stubbornness.
Among his posthumous manuscripts are a part of his History
of Corsica, and rich materials for a history of the commerce
of the naval powers. The death of Gregori filled not only
Corsica, but the men of science in France and Italy, with
deep sorrow.
</p>

<p>
He and Renucci also rendered good service to the public
library of Bastia, which contains sixteen thousand volumes,
and occupies a large building formerly belonging to the
Jesuits. They may be said, in fact, to have <i>made</i> this library,
which ranks with that of Ajaccio as second in the island.
Science in Corsica is still, on the whole, in its infancy. As
the historian Filippini, the contemporary of Sampiero, complains,&mdash;indolence,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
the mainly warlike bent given to the
nature of the Corsicans by their perpetual struggles, and the
consequent ignorance, entirely prevented the formation of a
literature. But it is remarkable, that in the year 1650 the
Corsicans founded an Academy of Sciences, the first president
of which was Geronimo Biguglia, the poet, advocate, theologian,
and historian. It is well known that people in those
times were fond of giving such academies the most whimsical
names; the Corsicans called theirs the Academy dei Vagabondi
(of the Vagabonds), and a more admirable and fitting
appellation they could not at that period have selected. The
Marquis of Cursay, whose memory is still affectionately cherished
by the Corsicans, restored this Academy; and Rousseau,
himself entitled to the name of Vagabond from his wandering
life, wrote a little treatise for this Corsican institution on the
question: "Which is the most necessary virtue for heroes,
and what heroes have been deficient in this virtue?"&mdash;a
genuinely Corsican subject.
</p>

<p>
The educational establishments&mdash;the Academy just referred
to has been dissolved&mdash;are, in Bastia, as in Corsica in
general, extremely inadequate. Bastia has a Lyceum, and
some lower schools. I was present at a distribution of prizes
in the highest of the girls' schools. It took place in the
court of the old college of the Jesuits, which was prettily
decorated, and in the evening brilliantly illuminated. The
girls, all in white, sat in rows before the principal citizens
and magistrates of the town, and received bay-wreaths&mdash;those
who had won them. The head mistress called the name of
the happy victress, who thereupon went up to her desk and
received the wreath, which she then brought to one of the
leading men of the town, silently conferring on him the favour
of crowning her, which ceremony was then gone through in
due form. Innumerable such bay-wreaths were distributed;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
and many a pretty child bore away perhaps ten or twelve of
them for her immortal works, receiving them all very gracefully.
It seemed to me, however, that wealthy parents, or
celebrated old families, were too much flattered; and they
never ceased crowning Miss Colonna d'Istria, Miss Abatucci,
Miss Saliceti&mdash;so that these young ladies carried more bays
home with them than would serve to crown the immortal
poets of a century. The graceful little festival&mdash;in which
there was certainly too much French flattering of vanity&mdash;was
closed by a play, very cleverly acted by the young
ladies.
</p>

<p>
Bastia has a single newspaper&mdash;<i>L'Ere Nouvelle, Journal de
la Corse</i>&mdash;which appears only on Fridays. Up till this summer,
the advocate Arrighi, a man of talent, was the editor.
The new Prefect of Corsica, described to me as a young official
without experience, exceedingly anxious to bring himself into
notice, like the Roman prefects of old in their provinces, had
been constantly finding fault with the Corsican press, the
most innocent in the world; and threatening, on the most
trifling pretexts, to withdraw the Government permission to
publish the paper in question, till at length M. Arrighi was
compelled to retire. The paper, entirely Bonapartist in its
politics, still exists; the only other journal in Corsica is the
Government paper in Ajaccio.
</p>

<p>
There are three bookselling establishments in Bastia, among
which the Libreria Fabiani would do honour even to a German
city. This house has published some beautiful works.

One class, and that the most original class in the island,
has no figure assigned to it in the above list&mdash;I mean the

there may be as many Corsican bandits in Sardinia.
</p>

<p>
That the reader may be able to form a clear idea of the
general administration of Corsica, I shall here furnish briefly
its more important details.
</p>

<p>
Corsica has been a department since the year 1811. It is
governed by a prefect, who resides in Ajaccio. He also discharges
the functions of sub-prefect for the arrondissement of
Ajaccio. He has four sub-prefects under him in the other
four arrondissements. The prefect is assisted by the Council
of the prefecture, consisting of three members, besides the prefect
as president, and deciding on claims of exemption, &amp;c.,
in connexion with taxes, the public works, the communal and
national estates. There is an appeal to the Council of State.
</p>

<p>
The General Council, the members of which are elected by
the voters of each canton, assembles yearly in Ajaccio to deliberate
on the public affairs of the nation. It is competent
to regulate the distribution of the direct taxes over the arrondissements.
The General Council can only meet by a decree
of the supreme head of the state, who determines the length
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
of the sitting. There is a representative for each canton, in
all, therefore, there are sixty-one.
</p>

<p>
In the chief town of each arrondissement meets a provincial
council of as many members as there are cantons in the arrondissement.
The citizens who, according to French law, are
entitled to vote, are also voters for the Legislative Assembly.
There are about 50,000 voters in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
Mayors, with adjuncts named by the prefect, conduct the
affairs of the communes; the people have retained so much of
their democratic rights, that they are allowed to elect the
municipal council over which the mayor presides.
</p>

<p>
As regards the administration of justice, the high court of
the department is the Appeal Court of Bastia, which consists
of one chief president, two <span lang='fr_FR'><i>présidents de chambre</i></span>, seventeen
councillors, one auditor, one procurator-general, two advocates-general,
one substitute, five clerks of court.
</p>

<p>
The Court of Assize holds its sittings in Bastia, and consists
of three appeal-councillors, the procurator-general, and
a clerk of court. It sits usually once every four months.
There is a Tribunal of First Instance in the principal town
of each arrondissement. There is also in each canton a
justice of the peace. Each commune has a tribunal of simple
municipal police, consisting of the mayor and his adjuncts.
</p>

<p>
The ecclesiastical administration is subject to the diocese
of Ajaccio, the bishop of which&mdash;the only one in Corsica&mdash;is
a suffragan of the Archbishop of Aix.
</p>

<p>
Corsica forms the seventeenth military division of France.
Its head-quarters are in Bastia, where the general of the
division resides. The gendarmerie, so important for Corsica,
forms the seventeenth legion, and is also stationed in Bastia.
It is composed of four companies, with four <i>chefs</i>, sixteen
lieutenancies, and one hundred and two brigades.
</p>

<p>
I add a few particulars in regard to agriculture and industrial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
affairs. Agriculture, the foundation of all national
wealth, is very low in Corsica. This is very evident from the
single fact, that the cultivated lands of the island amount to
a trifle more than three-tenths of the surface. The exact
area of the island is 874,741 hectars.<a name='FA_C' id='FA_C' href='#FN_C' class='fnanchor'>[C]</a> The progress of agriculture
is infinitely retarded by family feuds, bandit-life, the
community of land in the parishes, the want of roads, the
great distance of the tilled grounds from the dwellings, the
unwholesome atmosphere of the plains, and most of all by
the Corsican indolence.
</p>

<p>
Native industry is in a very languishing state. It is confined
to the merest necessaries&mdash;the articles indispensable to the common
handicrafts, and to sustenance; the women almost everywhere
wear the coarse brown Corsican cloth (<span lang='it_IT'><i>panno Corso</i></span>),
called also <span lang='it_IT'><i>pelvue</i></span>; the herdsmen prepare cheese, and a sort of
cheesecake, called <span lang='it_IT'><i>broccio</i></span>; the only saltworks are in the Gulf of
Porto Vecchio. There are anchovy, tunny, and coral fisheries
on many parts of the coast, but they are not diligently pursued.
</p>

<p>
The commerce of Corsica is equally trifling. The principle
export is oil, which the island yields so abundantly, that with
more cultivation it might produce to the value of sixty millions
of francs; it also exports pulse, chestnuts, fish, fresh and
salted, wood, dyeing plants, hides, corals, marble, a considerable
amount of manufactured tobacco, especially cigars, for
which the leaf is imported. The main imports are&mdash;grain of
various kinds, as rye, wheat, and rice; sugar, coffee, cattle,
cotton, lint, leather, wrought and unwrought iron, brick,
glass, stoneware.
</p>

<p>
The export and import are grievously disproportionate.
The Customs impose ruinous restrictions on all manufacture
and all commerce; they hinder foreigners from exchanging
their produce for the produce of the country; hence the Corsicans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
must pay tenfold for their commodities in France, while
even wine is imported from Provence free of duty, and thus
checks the native cultivation of the vine. For Corsica is, in
point of fact, precluded from exporting wine to France; France
herself being a productive wine country. Even meal and
vegetables are sent to the troops from Provence. The export
of tobacco to the Continent is forbidden.<a name='FA_D' id='FA_D' href='#FN_D' class='fnanchor'>[D]</a> The tyrannical
customs-regulations press with uncommon severity on the poor
island; and though she is compelled to purchase articles from
France to the value of three millions yearly, she sends into
France herself only a million and a half. And Corsica yields
the exchequer yearly 1,150,000 francs.
</p>

<p>
Bastia, Ajaccio, Isola Rossa, and Bonifazio are the principal
trading towns.
</p>

<p>
But however melancholy the condition of Corsica may be
in an industrial and a commercial point of view, its limited
population protects it at least from the scourge of pauperism,
which, in the opulent and cultivated countries of the Continent,
can show mysteries of a much more frightful character
than those of bandit-life and the Vendetta.
</p>

<p>
For five-and-twenty years now, with unimportant interruptions,
have the French been in possession of the island of
Corsica; and they have neither succeeded in healing the ever
open wound of the Corsican people, nor have they, with all
the means that advanced culture places at their disposal, done
anything for the country, beyond introducing a few very trifling
improvements. The island that has twice given France
her Emperor, and twice dictated her laws, has gained nothing
by it but the satisfaction of her revenge. The Corsican will
never forget the disgraceful way in which France appropriated
his country; and a high-spirited people never learns to love
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
its conquerors. When I heard the Corsicans, even of the
present day, bitterly inveighing against Genoa, I said to them&mdash;"Leave
the old Republic of Genoa alone; you have had
your full Vendetta on her&mdash;Napoleon, a Corsican, annihilated
her; France betrayed you, and bereft you of your nationality;
you have had your full Vendetta on France, for you sent her
your Corsican Napoleon, who enslaved her; and even now this
great France is a Corsican conquest, and your own province."
</p>

<p>
Two emperors, two Corsicans, on the throne of France,
bowing her down with despotic violence;&mdash;well, if an ideal conception
can have the worth of reality, then we are compelled
to say, never was a brave subjugated people more splendidly
avenged on its subduers. The name of Napoleon, it may be
confidently affirmed, is the only tie that binds the Corsican
nation to France; without this its relation to France would
be in no respect different from that of other conquered countries
to their foreign masters. I have read, in many authors,
the assertion that the Corsican nation is at the core of its
heart French. I hold this assertion to be a mistake, or an
intentional falsehood. I have never seen the least ground
for it. The difference between Corsican and Frenchman in
nationality, in the most fundamental elements of character
and feeling, puts a deep gulf between the two. The
Corsican is decidedly an Italian; his language is acknowledged
to be one of the purest dialects of Italian, his nature,
his soil, his history, still link the lost son to his old mother-country.
The French feel themselves strange in the island,
and both soldiers and officials consider their period of service
there as a "dreary exile in the isle of goats." The Corsican
does not even understand such a temperament as the French&mdash;for
he is grave, taciturn, chaste, consistent, thoroughly a
man, and steadfast as the granite of his country.
</p>

<p>
Corsican patriotism is not extinct. I saw it now and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
then burst out. The old grudge still stirs the bosom of the
Corsican, when he remembers the battle of Ponte Nuovo. Travelling
one day, in a public conveyance, over the battle-field
of Ponte Nuovo, a Corsican sitting beside me, a man from
the interior, pulled me vehemently by the arm, as we came in
sight of the famous bridge, and cried, with a passionate gesture&mdash;"This
is the spot where the Genoese murdered our
freedom&mdash;I mean the French." The reader will understand
this, when he remembers that the name of Genoese means
the same as deadly foe; for hatred of Genoa, the Corsicans
themselves say, is with them undying. Another time I
asked a Corsican, a man of education, if he was an Italian.
"Yes," said he, "for I am a Corsican." I understood him
well, and reached him my hand. These are isolated occurrences&mdash;accidents,
but frequently a living word, caught from
the mouth of the people, throws a vivid light on its state of
feeling, and suddenly reveals the truth that does not stand
in books compiled by officials.
</p>

<p>
I have heard it said again and again, and in all parts of the
country&mdash;"We Corsicans would gladly be Italian&mdash;for we
are in reality Italians, if Italy were only united and strong;
as she is at present, we must be French, for we need the support
of a great power; by ourselves we are too poor."
</p>

<p>
The Government does all it can to dislodge the Italian language,
and replace it with the French. All educated Corsicans
speak French, and, it is said, well; fashion, necessity, the prospect
of office, force it upon many. Sorry I was to meet Corsicans
(they were always young men) who spoke French with
each other evidently out of mere vanity. I could not refrain
on such occasions from expressing my astonishment that they
so thoughtlessly relinquished their beautiful native tongue for
that of the French. In the cities French is much spoken, but
the common people speak nothing but Italian, even when they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
have learned French at school, or by intercourse with Frenchmen.
French has not at all penetrated into the mountainous
districts of the interior, where the ancient, venerated customs
of the elder Corsicans&mdash;their primitive innocence, single-heartedness,
justice, generosity, and love of liberty&mdash;remain
unimpaired. Sad were it for the noble Corsican people
if they should one day exchange the virtues of their rude but
great forefathers for the refined corruption of enervated Parisian
society. The moral rottenness of society in France has
robbed the French nation of its strength. It has stolen like
an infection into society in other countries, deepened their demoralization,
and made incapacity for action general. It has
disturbed the hallowed foundation of all human society&mdash;the
family relation. But a people is ripe for despotism that has
lost the spirit of family. The whole heroic history of the
Corsicans has its source in the natural law of the inviolability
and sacredness of the family relation, and in that alone; even
their free constitution which they gave themselves in the
course of years, and completed under Paoli, is but a development
of the family. All the virtues of the Corsicans spring
from this spirit; even the frightful night-sides of their present
condition, such as the Vendetta, belong to the same root.
</p>

<p>
We look with shuddering on the avenger of blood, who
descends from his mountain haunts, to stab his foe's kindred,
man by man; yet this bloody vampire may, in manly vigour,
in generosity, and in patriotism, be a very hero compared with
such bloodless, sneaking villains, as are to be found contaminating
with their insidious presence the great society of our
civilisation, and secretly sucking out the souls of their fellow-men.

<p>
The second day after my arrival in Bastia, I was awakened
during the night by an appalling noise in my locanda, in the
street of the Jesuits. It was as if the Lapithæ and Centaurs
had got together by the ears. I spring to the door, and witness,
in the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>salle-à-manger</i></span>, the following scene:&mdash;Mine host
infuriated and vociferating at the pitch of his voice&mdash;his firelock
levelled at a man who lies before him on his knees,
other people vociferating, interfering, and trying to calm him
down; the man on his knees implores mercy: they put
him out of the house. It was a young man who had given
himself out in the locanda for a Marseillese, had played the
fine gentleman, and, in the end, could not pay his bill.
</p>

<p>
The second day after this, I happened to cross early in the
morning the Place San Nicolao, the public promenade of the
Bastinese, on my way to bathe. The executioners were just
erecting a guillotine beside the town-house, though not in the
centre of the Place, still on the promenade itself. Carabineers
and a crowd of people surrounded the shocking scene, to
which the laughing sea and the peaceful olive-groves formed
a contrast painfully impressive. The atmosphere was close
and heavy with the sirocco. Sailors and workmen stood in
groups on the quay, silently smoking their little chalk-pipes,
and gazing at the red scaffold, and not a few of them, in the
pointed barretto, brown jacket, hanging half off, half on; their
broad breasts bare, red handkerchiefs carelessly knotted about
their necks, looked as if they had more to do with the guillotine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
than merely to stare at it. And, in fact, there probably
was not one among the crowd who was not likely to meet
with the same fate, if accident but willed it, that the hallowed
custom of the Vendetta should stain his band with
murder, and murder should force him to the life of the
bandit.

"<span lang='it_IT'><i>Dio mio!</i></span>&mdash;he has killed ten men!"
</p>

<p>
"Ten men! and for what?"
</p>

<p>
"Out of <i>capriccio</i>."
</p>

<p>
I hastened into the sea to refresh myself with a bath, and
then back into my locanda, in order to see no more of what
passed. I was horror-struck at what I had heard and seen,
and a shuddering came over me in this wild solitude. I took
out my Dante; I felt as if I must read some of his wild phantasies
in the <i>Inferno</i>, where the pitch-devils thrust the doomed
souls down with harpoons as often as they rise for a mouthful
of air. My locanda lay in the narrow and gloomy street of
the Jesuits. An hour had elapsed, when a confused hum, and
the trample of horses' feet brought me to the window&mdash;they
were leading Bracciamozzo past, accompanied by the monks
called the Brothers of Death, in their hooded capotes, that
leave nothing of the face free but the eyes, which gleam
spectrally out through the openings left for them&mdash;veritable
demon-shapes, muttering in low hollow tones to themselves,
horrible, as if they had sprung from Dante's Hell into reality.
The bandit walked with a firm step between two priests, one
of whom held a crucifix before him. He was a young man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
of middle size, with beautiful bronze features and raven-black
curly hair, his face pale, and the pallor heightened by a fine
moustache. His left arm was bound behind his back, the
other was broken off near the shoulder. His eye, fiery no
doubt as a tiger's, when the murderous lust for blood tingled
through his veins, was still and calm. He seemed to be
murmuring prayers. His pace was steady, and his bearing
upright. Gendarmes rode at the head of the procession with
drawn swords; behind the bandit, the Brothers of Death
walked in pairs; the black coffin came last of all&mdash;a cross
and a death's-head rudely painted on it in white. It was
borne by four Brothers of Mercy. Slowly the procession
moved along the street of the Jesuits, followed by the murmuring
crowd; and thus they led the vampire with the broken
wing to the scaffold. My eyes have never lighted on a
scene more horrible, seldom on one whose slightest details
have so daguerreotyped themselves in my memory.
</p>

<p>
I was told afterwards that the bandit died without flinching,
and that his last words were: "I pray God and the
world for forgiveness, for I acknowledge that I have done
much evil."
</p>

<p>
This young man, people said to me, had not become a murderer
from personal reasons of revenge, that is, in order to
fulfil a Vendetta; he had become a bandit from ambition.
His story throws a great deal of light on the frightful state of
matters in the island. When Massoni was at the height of
his fame [this man had avenged the blood of a relation, and
then become bandit], Bracciamozzo, as the people began to
call the young Giacomino, after his arm had been mutilated,
carried him the means of sustenance: for these bandits have
always an understanding with friends and with goat-herds, who
bring them food in their lurking-places, and receive payment
when the outlaws have money. Giacomino, intoxicated with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
renown of the bold bandit Massoni, took it into his head to follow
his example, and become the admiration of all Corsica.
So he killed a man, took to the bush, and was a bandit. By
and bye he had killed ten men, and the people called him
Vecchio&mdash;the old one, probably because, though still quite
young, he had already shed as much blood as an old bandit.
One day Vecchio shot the universally esteemed physician
Malaspina, uncle of a hospitable entertainer of my own, a
gentleman of Balagna; he concealed himself in some brushwood,
and fired right into the <span lang='it_IT'><i>diligenza</i></span> as it passed along the
road from Bastia. The mad devil then sprang back into the
mountains, where at length justice overtook him.
</p>

<p>
A career of this frightful description, then, is possible for a
man in Corsica. Nobody there despises the bandit; he is
neither thief nor robber, but only fighter, avenger, and free
as the eagle on the hills. Hot-headed youths are fired with
the thought of winning fame by daring deeds of arms, and of
living in the ballads of the people. The inflammable temperament
of these men&mdash;who have been tamed by no culture, who
shun labour as a disgrace, and, thirsting for action, know
nothing of the world but the wild mountains among which
Nature has cooped them up within their sea-girt island&mdash;seems,
like a volcano, to insist on vent. On another, wider field,
and under other conditions, the same men who house for years
in caverns, and fight with sbirri in the bush, would become
great soldiers like Sampiero and Gaffori. The nature of the
Corsicans is the combative nature; and I can find no more
fitting epithet for them than that which Plato applies to
the race of men who are born for war, namely, "impassioned."<a name='FA_E' id='FA_E' href='#FN_E' class='fnanchor'>[E]</a>
The Corsicans are impassioned natures; passionate
in their jealousy and in their pursuit of fame; passionately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
quick in honour, passionately prone to revenge. Glowing with
all this fiery impetuosity, they are the born soldiers that
Plato requires.
</p>

<p>
After Bracciamozzo's execution, I was curious to see whether
the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>beau monde</i></span> of Bastia would promenade as usual on
the Place San Nicolao in the evening, and I did not omit
walking in that direction. And lo! there they were, moving
up and down on the Place Nicolao, where in the morning
bandit blood had flowed&mdash;the fair dames of Bastia. Nothing
now betrayed the scene of the morning; it was as if nothing
had happened. I also wandered there; the colouring of the
sea was magically beautiful. The fishing-skiffs floated on it
with their twinkling lights, and the fishermen sang their
beautiful song, <span lang='it_IT'><i>O pescator dell' onda</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
In Corsica they have nerves of granite, and no smelling-bottles.

THE VENDETTA, OR REVENGE TO THE DEATH.

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
<span lang='it_IT'>"Eterna faremo Vendetta."</span>&mdash;<i>Corsican Ballad.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>
The origin of the bandit life is to be sought almost exclusively
in the ancient custom of the Vendetta, that is, of exacting
blood for blood. Almost all writers on this subject, whom
I have read, state that the Vendetta began to be practised in
the times when Genoese justice was venal, or favoured murder.
Without doubt, the constant wars, and defective administration
of justice greatly contributed to the evil, and allowed
the barbarous custom to become inveterate, but its root lies
elsewhere. For the law of blood for blood does not prevail in
Corsica only, it exists also in other countries&mdash;in Sardinia, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
Calabria, in Sicily, among the Albanians and Montenegrins,
among the Circassians, Druses, Bedouins, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Like phenomena must arise under like conditions; and
these are not far to seek, for the social condition of all these
peoples is similar. They all lead a warlike and primitive life;
nature around them is wild and impressive; they are all, with
the exception of the Bedouins, poor mountaineers inhabiting
regions not easily accessible to culture, and clinging, with the
utmost obstinacy, to their primitive condition and ancient barbarous
customs; further, they are all equally penetrated with
the same intense family sympathies, and these form the sacred
basis of such social life as they possess. In a state of nature,
and in a society rent asunder by prevailing war and insecurity,
the family becomes a state in itself; its members cleave fast to
each other; if one is injured, the entire little state is wronged.
The family exercises justice only through itself, and the form
this exercise of justice takes, is revenge. And thus it appears
that the law of blood for blood, though barbarous, still springs
from the injured sense of justice, and the natural affection of
blood-relations, and that its source is a noble one&mdash;the human
heart. The Vendetta is barbarian justice. Now the high
sense of justice characterizing the Corsicans is acknowledged
and eulogized even by the authors of antiquity.
</p>

<p>
Two noble and great passions have, all along, swayed the
the Corsican mind&mdash;the love of family and the love of country.
In the case of a quite poor people, living in a sequestered
island&mdash;an island, moreover, mountainous, rugged, and stern&mdash;these
passions could not but be intense, for to that nation they
were all the world. Love of country produced that heroic
history of Corsica which we know, and which is in reality nothing
but an inveterate Vendetta against Genoa, handed down
for ages from father to son; and love of family has produced
the no less bloody, and no less heroic history of the Vendetta, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
tragedy of which is not yet played to an end. The exhaustless
native energy of this little people is really something inconceivable,
since, while rending itself to pieces in a manner the
most sanguinary, it, at the same time, possessed the strength
to maintain so interminable and so glorious a struggle with
its external foes.
</p>

<p>
The love of his friends is still to the Corsican what it was
in the old heroic times&mdash;a religion; only the love of his country
is with him a higher duty. Many examples from Corsican
history show this. As among the ancient Hellenes,
fraternal love ranked as love's highest and purest form, so it
is ranked among the Corsicans. In Corsica, the fraternal
relation is viewed as the holiest of all relations, and the
names of brother and sister indicate the purest happiness the
heart can have&mdash;its noblest treasure, or its saddest loss. The
eldest brother, as the stay of the family, is revered simply in
his character as such. I believe nothing expresses so fully
the range of feeling, and the moral nature of a people, as its
songs. Now the Corsican song is strictly a dirge, which
is at the same time a song of revenge; and most of these
songs of revenge are dirges of the sister for her brother who
has fallen. I have always found in this poetry that where-ever
all love and all laudation are heaped upon the dead,
it is said of him, He was my brother. Even the wife, when
giving the highest expression to her love, calls her husband,
brother. I was astonished to find precisely the same modes
of expression and feeling in the Servian popular poetry; with
the Servian woman, too, the most endearing name for her husband
is brother, and the most sacred oath among the Servians
is when a man swears by his brother. Among unsophisticated
nations, the natural religion of the heart is preserved in their
most ordinary sentiments and relations&mdash;for these have their
ground in that which alone is lasting in the circumstances of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
human life; the feeling of a people cleaves to what is simple
and enduring. Fraternal love and filial love express the simplest
and most enduring relations on earth, for they are relations
without passion. And the history of human wo begins
with Cain the fratricide.
</p>

<p>
Wo, therefore, to him who has slain the Corsican's brother
or blood-relation! The deed is done; the murderer flees
from a double dread&mdash;of justice, which punishes murder; and
of the kindred of the slain, who avenge murder. For as soon
as the deed has become known, the relations of the fallen
man take their weapons, and hasten to find the murderer.
The murderer has escaped to the woods; he climbs perhaps
to the perpetual snow, and lives there with the wild sheep:
all trace of him is lost. But the murderer has relatives&mdash;brothers,
cousins, a father; these relatives know that they
must answer for the deed with their lives. They arm themselves,
therefore, and are upon their guard. The life of those
who are thus involved in a Vendetta is most wretched. He
who has to fear the Vendetta instantly shuts himself up in
his house, and barricades door and window, in which he leaves
only loop-holes. The windows are lined with straw and
with mattresses; and this is called <span lang='it_IT'><i>inceppar le fenestre</i></span>. The
Corsican house among the mountains, in itself high, almost
like a tower, narrow, with a high stone stair, is easily turned
into a fortress. Intrenched within it, the Corsican keeps
close, always on his guard lest a ball reach him through the
window. His relatives go armed to their labour in the field,
and station sentinels; their lives are in danger at every step.
I have been told of instances in which Corsicans did not
leave their intrenched dwellings for ten, and even for fifteen
years, spending all this period of their lives besieged, and in
deadly fear; for Corsican revenge never sleeps, and the Corsican
never forgets. Not long ago, in Ajaccio, a man who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
had lived for ten years in his room, and at last ventured upon
the street, fell dead upon the threshold of his house as he
re-entered: the ball of him who had watched him for ten
years had pierced his heart.
</p>

<p>
I see, walking about here in the streets of Bastia, a man
whom the people call Nasone, from his large nose. He is of
gigantic size, and his repulsive features are additionally disfigured
by the scar of a frightful wound in his eye. Some
years ago he lived in the neighbouring village of Pietra Nera.
He insulted another inhabitant of the place; this man swore
revenge. Nasone intrenched himself in his house, and closed
up the windows, to protect himself from balls. A considerable
time passed, and one day he ventured abroad; in
a moment his foe sprang upon him, a pruning-knife in his
hand. They wrestled fearfully; Nasone was overpowered;
and his adversary, who had already given him a blow in
the neck, was on the point of hewing off his head on the
stump of a tree, when some people came up. Nasone recovered;
the other escaped to the macchia. Again a considerable
time passed. Once more Nasone ventured into
the street: a ball struck him in the eye. They raised the
wounded man; and again his giant nature conquered, and
healed him. The furious bandit now ravaged his enemy's
vineyard during the night, and attempted to fire his house.
Nasone removed to the city, and goes about there as a living
example of Corsican revenge&mdash;an object of horror to the
peaceable stranger who inquires his history. I saw the
hideous man one day on the shore, but not without his double-barrel.
His looks made my flesh creep; he was like the
demon of revenge himself.
</p>

<p>
Not to take revenge is considered by the genuine Corsicans
as degrading. Thirst for vengeance is with them an entirely
natural sentiment&mdash;a passion that has become hallowed. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
their songs, revenge has a <span lang='la'><i>cultus</i></span>, and is celebrated as a
religion of filial piety. Now, a sentiment which the poetry
of a people has adopted as an essential characteristic of the
nationality is ineradicable; and this in the highest degree, if
woman has ennobled it as <i>her</i> feeling. Girls and women
have composed most of the Corsican songs of revenge, and
they are sung from mountain-top to shore. This creates a
very atmosphere of revenge, in which the people live and the
children grow up, sucking in the wild meaning of the Vendetta
with their mother's milk. In one of these songs, it is
said that twelve lives are insufficient to avenge the fallen
man's&mdash;boots! That is Corsican. A man like Hamlet, who
struggles to fill himself with the spirit of the Vendetta, and
cannot do it, would be pronounced by the Corsicans the most
despicable of all poltroons. Nowhere in the world, perhaps,
does human blood and human life count for so little as in
Corsica. The Corsican is ready to take life, but he is also
ready to die.
</p>

<p>
Any one who shrinks from avenging himself&mdash;a milder disposition,
perhaps, or a tincture of philosophy, giving him
something of Hamlet's hesitancy&mdash;is allowed no rest by his
relations, and all his acquaintances upbraid him with pusillanimity.
To reproach a man for suffering an injury to
remain unavenged is called <span lang='it_IT'><i>rimbeccare</i></span>. The old Genoese
statute punished the <span lang='it_IT'><i>rimbecco</i></span> as incitation to murder. The
law runs thus, in the nineteenth chapter of these statutes:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Of those who upbraid, or say <span lang='it_IT'><i>rimbecco</i></span>.&mdash;If any one upbraids
or says <span lang='it_IT'><i>rimbecco</i></span> to another, because that other has not
avenged the death of his father, or of his brother, or of any
other blood-relation, or because he has not taken vengeance
on account of other injuries and insults done upon himself,
the person so upbraiding shall be fined in from twenty-five to
fifty lire for each time, according to the judgment of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
magistrate, and regard being had to the quality of the person,
and to other circumstances; and if he does not pay forthwith,
or cannot pay within eight days, then shall he be
banished from the island for one year, or the corda shall be
put upon him once, according to the judgment of the magistrate."
</p>

<p>
In the year 1581, the severity of the law was so far increased,
that the tongue of any one saying <span lang='it_IT'><i>rimbecco</i></span> was
publicly pierced. Now, it is especially the women who incite
the men to revenge, in their dirges over the corpse of the person
who has been slain, and by exhibiting the bloody shirt.
The mother fastens a bloody rag of the father's shirt to the
dress of her son, as a perpetual admonition to him that he has
to effect vengeance. The passions of these people have a
frightful, a demoniac glow.
</p>

<p>
In former times the Corsicans practised the chivalrous custom
of previously <i>proclaiming</i> the war of the Vendetta, and
also to what degree of consanguinity the vengeance was to
extend. The custom has fallen into disuse. Owing to the
close relationship between various families, the Vendetta, of
course, crosses and recrosses from one to another, and the
Vendetta that thus arises is called in Corsica, <span lang='it_IT'><i>Vendetta transversale</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
In intimate and perfectly natural connexion with this custom,
stand the Corsican family feuds, still at the present day
the scourge of the unhappy island. The families in a state
of Vendetta, immediately draw into it all their relatives, and
even friends; and in Corsica, as in other countries where the
social condition of the population is similar, the tie of clan is
very strong. Thus wars between families arise within one
and the same village, or between village and village, glen and
glen; and the war continues, and blood is shed for years.
Vendetta, or lesser injuries&mdash;frequently the merest accidents&mdash;afford
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
occasion, and with temperaments so passionate as those
of the Corsicans, the slightest dispute may easily terminate
in blood, as they all go armed. The feud extends even to
the children; instances have been known in which children
belonging to families at feud have stabbed and shot each
other. There are in Corsica certain relations of clientship&mdash;remains
of the ancient feudal system of the time of the
seigniors, and this clientship prevails more especially in
the country beyond the mountains, where the descendants
of the old seigniors live on their estates. They have no
vassals now, but dependants, friends, people in various ways
bound to them. These readily band together as the adherents
of the house, and are then, according to the Corsican
expression, the <span lang='it_IT'><i>geniali</i></span>, their protectors being the <span lang='it_IT'><i>patrocinatori</i></span>.
Thus, as in the cities of mediæval Italy, we have
still in Corsica wars of families, as a last remnant of the
feuds of the seigniors. The granite island has maintained
an obstinate grasp on her antiquity; her warlike history and
constant internal dissensions, caused by the ambition and
overbearing arrogance of the seigniors, have stamped the
spirit of party on the country, and till the present day it remains
rampant.
</p>

<p>
In Corsica, the frightful word "enemy" has still its full old
meaning. The enemy is there the deadly enemy; he who is
at enmity with another, goes out to take his enemy's life, and
in so doing risks his own. We, too, have brought the old
expression "deadly enemy" with us from a more primitive
state, but the meaning we attach to it is more abstract. <i>Our</i>
deadly enemies have no wish to murder us&mdash;they do us harm
behind our backs, they calumniate us, they injure us secretly
in all possible ways, and often we do not so much as know who
they are. The hatreds of civilisation have usually something
mean in them; and hence, in our modern society, a man of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
noble feeling can no longer be an enemy&mdash;he can only despise.
But deadly foes in Corsica attack the life; they have loudly
and publicly sworn revenge to the death, and wherever they
find each other, they stab and shoot. There is a frightful
manliness in this; it shows an imposing, though savage and
primitive force of character. Barbarous as such a state of
society is, it nevertheless compels us to admire the natural
force which it develops, especially as the Corsican avenger is
frequently a really tragic individual, urged by fate, because
by venerated custom, to murder. For even a noble nature
can here become a Cain, and they who wander as bandits
on the hills of this island, are often bearers of the curse of
barbarous custom, and not of their own vileness, and may be
men of virtues that would honour and signalize them in the
peaceable life of a civil community.
</p>

<p>
A single passion, sprung from noble source&mdash;revenge, and
nothing but revenge! it is wonderful with what irresistible
might it seizes on a man. Revenge is, for the poor Corsicans,
the dread goddess of Fate, who makes their history. And
thus through a single passion man becomes the most frightful
demon, and more merciless than the Avenging Angel himself,
for he does not content himself with the first-born. Yet dark
and sinister as the human form here appears, the dreadful
passion, nevertheless, produces its bright contrast. Where
foes are foes for life and death, friends are friends for life and
death; where revenge lacerates the heart with tiger blood-thirstiness,
there love is capable of resolutions the most sublime;
there we find heroic forgetfulness of self, and the
Divine clemency of forgiveness; and nowhere else is it possible
to see the Christian precept, Love thine enemy, realized
in a more Christian way than in the land of the Vendetta.
</p>

<p>
Often, too, mediators, called <span lang='it_IT'><i>parolanti</i></span>, interfere between the
parties at feud, who swear before them an oath of reconciliation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
This oath is religiously sacred; he who breaks it is an
outlaw, and dishonoured before God and man. It is seldom
broken, but it is broken, for the demon has made his lair in
human hearts.

<p>
How the Corsican may be compelled to live as bandit, may
be suddenly hurled from his peaceable home, and the quiet of
civic life, into the mountain fastnesses, to wander henceforth
with the ban of outlawry on him, will be clear from what we
have seen of the Vendetta.
</p>

<p>
The Corsican bandit is not, like the Italian, a thief and
robber, but strictly what his name implies&mdash;a man whom the
law has <i>banned</i>. According to the old statute, all those are
<span lang='it_IT'><i>banditti</i></span> on whom sentence of banishment from the island has
been passed, because justice has not been able to lay hands
on them. They were declared outlaws, and any one was free
to slay a bandit if he came in his way. The idea of banishment
has quite naturally been extended to all whom the law
proscribes.
</p>

<p>
The isolation of Corsica, want of means, and love of their
native soil, prevent the outlawed Corsicans from leaving their
island. In former times, Corsican bandits occasionally escaped
to Greece, where they fought bravely; at present, many seek
refuge in Italy, and still more in Sardinia, if they prefer to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
leave their country. Flight from the law is nowhere in the
world a simpler matter than in Corsica. The blood has
scarcely been shed before the doer of the deed is in the hills,
which are everywhere close at hand, and where he easily conceals
himself in the impenetrable macchia. From the moment
that he has entered the macchia, he is termed bandit. His
relatives and friends alone are acquainted with his traces; as
long as it is possible, they furnish him with necessaries; many
a dark night they secretly receive him into their houses; and
however hard pressed, the bandit always finds some goat-herd
who will supply his wants.
</p>

<p>
The main haunts of the bandits are between Tor and Mount
Santo Appiano, in the wildernesses of Monte Cinto and Monte
Rotondo, and in the inaccessible regions of Niolo. There the
deep shades of natural forests that have never seen an axe,
and densest brushwood of dwarf-oak, albatro, myrtles, and
heath, clothe the declivities of the mountains; wild torrents
roar unseen through gloomy ravines, where every path is lost;
and caves, grottos, and shattered rocks, afford concealment.
There the bandit lives, with the falcon, the fox, and the wild
sheep, a life more romantic and more comfortless than that of
the American savage. Justice takes her course. She has condemned
the bandit <span lang='la'><i>in contumaciam</i></span>. The bandit laughs at
her; he says in his strange way, "I have got the <span lang='it_IT'><i>sonetto</i></span>!"
meaning the sentence <span lang='la'><i>in contumaciam</i></span>. The sbirri are out
upon his track&mdash;the avengers of blood the same&mdash;he is in constant
flight&mdash;he is the Wandering Jew of the desolate hills.
Now come the conflicts with the gendarmes, heroic, fearful
conflicts; his hands grow bloodier; but not with the blood of
sbirri only, for the bandit is avenger too; it is not for love to
his wretched life&mdash;it is far rather for revenge that he lives.
He has sworn death to his enemy's kindred. One can imagine
what a wild and fierce intensity his vengeful feelings must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
acquire in the frightful savageness of nature round him, and
in its yet more frightful solitude, under constant thoughts of
death, and dreams of the scaffold. Sometimes the bandit
issues from the mountains to slay his enemy; when he has
accomplished his vengeance, he vanishes again in the hills.
Not seldom the Corsican bandit rises into a Carl Moor<a name='FA_F' id='FA_F' href='#FN_F' class='fnanchor'>[F]</a>&mdash;into
an avenger upon society of real or supposed injuries it has
done him. The history of the bandit Capracinta of Prunelli
is still well known in Corsica. The authorities had unjustly
condemned his father to the galleys; the son forthwith took
to the macchia with some of his relations, and these avengers
from time to time descended from the mountains, and stabbed
and shot personal enemies, soldiers, and spies; they one day
captured the public executioner, and executed the man himself.
</p>

<p>
It frequently happens, as we might naturally expect, that
the bandits allow themselves to become the tools of others
who have a Vendetta to accomplish, and who have recourse
to them for the obligation of a dagger or a bullet. In a country
of such limited extent, and where the families are so intricately
and so widely connected, the bandits cannot but become formidable.
They are the sanguinary scourges of the country;
agriculture is neglected, the vineyards lie waste&mdash;for who will
venture into the field if he is menaced by Massoni or Serafino?
There are, moreover, among the bandits, men who were previously
accustomed to exercise influence upon others, and to take
part in public life. Banished to the wilderness, their inactivity
becomes intolerable to them; and I was assured that some,
in their caverns and hiding-places, continue even to read newspapers
which they contrive to procure. They frequently exert
an influence of terror on the communal elections, and even on
the elections for the General Council. It is no unusual thing for
them to threaten judges and witnesses, and to effect a bloody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
revenge for the sentence pronounced. This, and the great
mildness of the verdicts usually brought in by Corsican juries,
have been the ground of a wish, already frequently expressed,
for the abolition of the jury in Corsica. It is not to be denied
that a Corsican jury-box may be influenced by the fear of the
vengeance of the bandits; but if we accuse them indiscriminately
of excessive leniency, we shall in many cases do these
jurymen wrong; for the bandit life and its causes must be
viewed under the conditions of Corsican society. I was present
at the sitting of a jury in Bastia, an hour after the execution
of Bracciamozzo, and in the same building in front of
which he had been guillotined; the impression of the public
execution seemed to me perceptible in the appearance of the
jury and the spectators, but not in that of the prisoner at the
bar. He was a young man who had shot some one&mdash;he had
a stolid hardened face, and his skull looked like a negro's, as
if you might use it for an anvil. Neither what had lately
occurred, nor the solemnity of the proceedings of the assize,
made the slightest impression on the fellow; he showed no
trace of embarrassment or fear, but answered the interrogatories
of the examining judge with the greatest <span lang='fr_FR'><i>sang-froid</i></span>,
expressing himself briefly and concisely as to the circumstances
of his murderous act. I have forgotten to how many
years' confinement he was sentenced.
</p>

<p>
Although the Corsican bandit never lowers himself to common
robbery, he holds it not inconsistent with his knightly
honour to extort money. The bandits levy black-mail, they
tax individuals, frequently whole villages, according to their
means, and call in their tribute with great strictness. They impose
these taxes as kings of the bush; and I was told their subjects
paid them more promptly and conscientiously than they
do their taxes to the imperial government of France. It often
happens, that the bandit sends a written order into the house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
of some wealthy individual, summoning him to deposit so
many thousand francs in a spot specified; and informing him
that if he refuses, himself, his house, and his vineyards, will
be destroyed. The usual formula of the threat is&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>Si preparasse</i></span>&mdash;let
him prepare. Others, again, fall into the hands
of the bandits, and have to pay a ransom for their release. All
intercourse becomes thus more and more insecure; agriculture
impossible. With the extorted money, the bandits enrich
their relatives and friends, and procure themselves many a
favour; they cannot put the money to any immediate personal
use&mdash;for though they had it in heaps, they must nevertheless
continue to live in the caverns of the mountain wilds, and in
constant flight.
</p>

<p>
Many bandits have led their outlaw life for fifteen or twenty
years, and, small as is the range allowed them by their hills,
have maintained themselves successfully against the armed
power of the State, victorious in every struggle, till the bandit's
fate at length overtook them. The Corsican banditti
do not live in troops, as in this way the country could not
support them; and, moreover, the Corsican is by nature indisposed
to submit to the commands of a leader. They generally
live in twos, contracting a sort of brotherhood. They
have their deadly enmities among themselves too, and their
deadly revenge; this is astonishing, but so powerful is the
personal feel of revenge with the Corsican, that the similarity
of their unhappy lot never reconciles bandit with bandit, if a
Vendetta has existed between them. Many stories are told
of one bandit's hunting another among the hills, till he had
slain him, on account of a Vendetta. Massoni and Serafino,
the two latest bandit heroes of Corsica, were at feud, and shot
at each other when opportunity offered. A shot of Massoni's
had deprived Serafino of one of his fingers.
</p>

<p>
The history of the Corsican bandits is rich in extraordinary,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
heroic, chivalrous, traits of character. Throughout the whole
country they sing the bandit dirges; and naturally enough, for
it is their own fate, their own sorrow, that they thus sing. Numbers
of the bandits have become immortal; but the bold deeds
of one especially are still famous. His name was Teodoro,
and he called himself king of the mountains. Corsica has
thus had two kings of the name of Theodore. Teodoro Poli
was enrolled on the list of conscripts, one day in the beginning
of the present century. He had begged to be allowed time
to raise money for a substitute. He was seized, however, and
compelled to join the ranks. Teodoro's high spirit and love
of freedom revolted at this. He threw himself into the mountains,
and began to live as bandit. He astonished all Corsica
by his deeds of audacious hardihood, and became the terror
of the island. But no meanness stained his fame; on the
contrary, his generosity was the theme of universal praise,
and he forgave even relatives of his enemies. His personal
appearance was remarkably handsome, and, like his namesake,
the king, he was fond of rich and fantastic dress. His
lot was shared by his mistress, who lived in affluence on the
contributions (<span lang='it_IT'><i>taglia</i></span>) which Teodoro imposed upon the villages.
Another bandit, called Brusco, to whom he had vowed inviolable
friendship, also lived with him, and his uncle Augellone.
Augellone means <i>bird of ill omen</i>&mdash;it is customary for
the bandits to give themselves surnames as soon as they
begin to play a part in the macchia. The Bird of Ill Omen
became envious of Brusco, because Teodoro was so fond of
him, and one day he put the cold iron a little too deep into
his breast. He thereupon made off into the rocks. When
Teodoro heard of the fall of Brusco, he cried aloud for grief,
not otherwise than Achilles at the fall of Patroclus, and,
according to the old custom of the avengers, began to let his
beard grow, swearing never to cut it till he had bathed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
the blood of Augellone. A short time passed, and Teodoro
was once more seen with his beard cut. These are the little
tragedies of which the mountain fastnesses are the scene, and
the bandits the players&mdash;for the passions of the human heart
are everywhere the same. Teodoro at length fell ill. A spy
gave information of the hiding-place of the sick lion, and the
wild wolf-hounds, the sbirri, were immediately among the
hills&mdash;they killed Teodoro in a goat-herd's shieling. Two of
them, however, learned how dangerously he could still handle
his weapons. The popular ballad sings of him, that he fell
with the pistol in his hand and the firelock by his side, <span lang='it_IT'><i>come
un fiero paladino</i></span>&mdash;like a proud paladin. Such was the respect
which this king of the mountains had inspired, that the people
continued to pay his tribute, even after his fall. For at his
death there was still some due, and those who owed the
arrears came and dropped their money respectfully into the
cradle of the little child, the offspring of Teodoro and his
queen. Teodoro met his death in the year 1827.
</p>

<p>
Gallocchio is another celebrated outlaw. He had conceived
an attachment for a girl who became faithless to him, and he
had forbidden any other to seek her hand. Cesario Negroni
wooed and won her. The young Gallocchio gave one of his
friends a hint to wound the father-in-law. The wedding
guests are dancing merrily, merrily twang the fiddles and the
mandolines&mdash;a shot! The ball had missed its way, and
pierced the father-in-law's heart. Gallocchio now becomes
bandit. Cesario intrenches himself. But Gallocchio forces
him to leave the building, hunts him through the mountains,
finds him, kills him. Gallocchio now fled to Greece, and
fought there against the Turks. One day the news reached
him that his own brother had fallen in the Vendetta war
which had continued to rage between the families involved
in it by the death of the father-in-law, and that of Cesario.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
Gallocchio came back, and killed two brothers of Cesario;
then more of his relatives, till at length he had extirpated
his whole family. The red Gambini was his comrade; with
his aid he constantly repulsed the gendarmes; and on one
occasion they bound one of them to a horse's tail, and dragged
him so over the rocks. Gambini fled to Greece, where the
Turks cut off his head; but Gallocchio died in his sleep, for
a traitor shot him.
</p>

<p>
Santa Lucia Giammarchi is also famous; he held the bush
for sixteen years; Camillo Ornano ranged the mountains for
fourteen years; and Joseph Antommarchi was seventeen years
a bandit.
</p>

<p>
The celebrated bandit Serafino was shot shortly before my
arrival in Corsica; he had been betrayed, and was slain
while asleep. Arrighi, too, and the terrible Massoni, had met
their death a short time previously&mdash;a death as wild and
romantic as their lives had been.
</p>

<p>
Massoni was a man of the most daring spirit, and unheard
of energy; he belonged to a wealthy family in Balagna. The
Vendetta had driven him into the mountains, where he lived
many years, supported by his relations, and favoured by the
herdsmen, killing, in frequent struggles, a great number of
sbirri. His companions were his brother and the brave Arrighi.
One day, a man of the province of Balagna, who had
to avenge the blood of a kinsman on a powerful family, sought
him out, and asked his assistance. The bandit received him
hospitably, and as his provisions happened to be exhausted at
the time, went to a shepherd of Monte Rotondo, and demanded
a lamb; the herdsman gave him one from his flock. Massoni,
however, refused it, saying&mdash;"You give me a lean lamb, and
yet to-day I wish to do honour to a guest; see, yonder is
a fat one, I must have it;" and instantly he shot the fat lamb
down, and carried it off to his cave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The shepherd was provoked by the unscrupulous act.
Meditating revenge, he descended from the hills, and offered
to show the sbirri Massoni's lurking-place. The shepherd
was resolved to avenge the blood of his lamb. The sbirri
came up the hills, in force. These Corsican gendarmes, well
acquainted with the nature of their country, and practised in
banditti warfare, are no less brave and daring than the game
they hunt. Their lives are in constant danger when they
venture into the mountains; for the bandits are watchful&mdash;they
keep a look-out with their telescopes, with which they
are always provided, and when danger is discovered they are
up and away more swiftly than the muffro, the wild sheep;
or they let their pursuers come within ball-range, and they
never miss their mark.
</p>

<p>
The sbirri, then, ascended the hills, the shepherd at their
head; they crept up the rocks by paths which he alone knew.
The bandits were lying in a cave. It was almost inaccessible,
and concealed by bushes. Arrighi and the brother of Massoni
lay within, Massoni himself sat behind the bushes on the
watch.
</p>

<p>
Some of the sbirri had reached a point above the cave,
others guarded its mouth. Those above looked down into the
bush to see if they could make out anything. One sbirro
took a stone and pitched it into the bush, in which he thought
he saw some black object; in a moment a man sprang out,
and fired a pistol to awake those in the cavern. But the
same instant were heard the muskets of the sbirri, and Massoni
fell dead on the spot.
</p>

<p>
At the report of the fire-arms a man leapt out of the cave,
Massoni's brother. He bounded like a wild-goat in daring
leaps from crag to crag, the balls whizzing about his head.
One hit him fatally, and he fell among the rocks. Arrighi,
who saw everything that passed, kept close within the cave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
The gendarmes pressed cautiously forward, but for a while no
one dared to enter the grotto, till at length some of the hardiest
ventured in. There was nobody to be seen; the sbirri, however,
were not to be cheated, and confident that the cavern
concealed their man, camped about its mouth.
</p>

<p>
Night came. They lighted torches and fires. It was resolved
to starve Arrighi into surrender; in the morning some
of them went to a spring near the cave to fetch water&mdash;the
crack of a musket once, twice, and two sbirri fell. Their
companions, infuriated, fired into the cavern&mdash;all was still.
</p>

<p>
The next thing to be done was to bring in the two dead or
dying men. After much hesitation a party made the attempt,
and again it cost one of them his life. Another day passed.
At last it occurred to one of them to smoke the bandit out
like a badger&mdash;a plan already adopted with success in Algiers.
They accordingly heaped dry wood at the entrance of the
cave, and set fire to it; but the smoke found egress through
chinks in the rock. Arrighi heard every word that was said,
and kept up actual dialogues with the gendarmes, who could
not see, much less hit him. He refused to surrender, although
pardon was promised him. At length the procurator, who
had been brought from Ajaccio, sent to the city of Corte for
military and an engineer. The engineer was to give his
opinion as to whether the cave might be blown up with gunpowder.
The engineer came, and said it was possible to
throw petards into it. Arrighi heard what was proposed, and
found the thought of being blown to atoms with the rocks of
his hiding-place so shocking, that he resolved on flight.
</p>

<p>
He waited till nightfall, then rolling some stones down in
a false direction, he sprang away from rock to rock, to reach
another mountain. The uncertain shots of the sbirri echoed
through the darkness. One ball struck him on the thigh.
He lost blood, and his strength was failing; when the day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195'>[195]</a></span>
dawned, his bloody track betrayed him, as its bloody sweat
the stricken deer. The sbirri took up the scent. Arrighi,
wearied to death, had lain down under a block. On this
block a sbirro mounted, his piece ready. Arrighi stretched
out his head to look around him&mdash;a report, and the ball was
in his brain.
</p>

<p>
So died these three outlawed avengers, fortunate that they did
not end on the scaffold. Such was their reputation, however,
with the people, that none of the inhabitants of Monte Rotondo
or its neighbourhood would lend his mule to convey
away the bodies of the fallen men. For, said these people,
we will have no part in the blood that you have shed. When
at length mules had been procured, the dead men, bandits
and sbirri, were put upon their backs, and the troop of gendarmes
descended the hills, six corpses hanging across the
mule-saddles, six men killed in the banditti warfare.
</p>

<p>
If this island of Corsica could again give forth all the blood
which in the course of centuries has been shed upon it&mdash;the
blood of those who have fallen in battle, and the blood of
those who have fallen in the Vendetta&mdash;the red deluge would
inundate its cities and villages, and drown its people, and
crimson the sea from the Corsican shore to Genoa. Verily,
violent death has here his peculiar realm.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to believe what the historian Filippini tells
us, that, in thirty years of his own time, 28,000 Corsicans
had been murdered out of revenge. According to the calculation
of another Corsican historian, I find that in the
thirty-two years previous to 1715, 28,715 murders had been
committed in Corsica. The same historian calculates that,
according to this proportion, the number of the victims of
the Vendetta, from 1359 to 1729, was 333,000. An equal
number, he is of opinion, must be allowed for the wounded.
We have, therefore, within the time specified, 666,000 Corsicans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
struck by the hand of the assassin. This people resembles
the hydra, whose heads, though cut off, constantly
grow on anew.
</p>

<p>
According to the speech of the Corsican Prefect before the
General Council of the Departments, in August 1852, 4300
murders (<span lang='fr_FR'><i>assassinats</i></span>) have been committed since 1821;
during the four years ending with 1851, 833; during the
last two of these 319, and during the first seven months of
1852, 99.
</p>

<p>
The population of the island is 250,000.
</p>

<p>
The Government proposes to eradicate the Vendetta and
the bandit life by a general disarming of the people. How this
is to be effected, and whether it is at all practicable, I cannot
tell. It will occasion mischief enough, for the bandits cannot
be disarmed along with the citizens, and their enemies will be
exposed defenceless to their balls. The bandit life, the family
feuds, and the Vendetta, which the law has been powerless to
prevent, have hitherto made it necessary to permit the carrying
of arms. For, since the law cannot protect the individual,
it must leave him at liberty to protect himself; and thus it
happens that Corsican society finds itself, in a sense, without
the pale of the state, in the condition of natural law, and
armed self-defence. This is a strange and startling phenomenon
in Europe in our present century. It is long since the
wearing of pistols and daggers was forbidden, but every one
here carries his double-barreled gun, and I have found half
villages in arms, as if in a struggle against invading barbarians&mdash;a
wild, fantastic spectacle, these reckless men all
about one in some lonely and dreary region of the hills, in
their shaggy pelone, and Phrygian cap, the leathern cartridge-belt
about their waist, and gun upon their shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is likely to eradicate the Vendetta, murder, and
the bandit life, but advanced culture. Culture, however, advances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
very slowly in Corsica. Colonization, the making of
roads through the interior, such an increase of general intercourse
and industry as would infuse life into the ports&mdash;this
might amount to a complete disarming of the population.
The French Government, utterly powerless against the defiant
Corsican spirit, most justly deserves reproach for allowing an
island which possesses the finest climate; districts of great
fertility; a position commanding the entire Mediterranean between
Spain, France, Italy, and Africa; and the most magnificent
gulfs and harbours; which is rich in forests, in minerals,
in healing springs, and in fruits, and is inhabited by a brave,
spirited, highly capable people&mdash;for allowing Corsica to become
a Montenegro or Italian Ireland.

<span class="b12">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />

<br />
SOUTHERN PART OF CAPE CORSO.
</h3>

<p>
Cape Corso is the long narrow peninsula which Corsica
throws out to the north.
</p>

<p>
It is traversed by a rugged mountain range, called the
Serra, the highest summits of which, Monte Alticcione and
Monte Stello, reach an altitude of more than 5000 feet. Rich
and beautiful valleys run down on both sides to the sea.
</p>

<p>
I had heard a great deal of the beauty of the valleys of this
region, of their fertility in wine and oranges, and of the gentle
manners of their inhabitants, so that I began my wanderings
in it with true pleasure. A cheerful and festive impression
is produced at the very first by the olive-groves that line the
excellent road along the shore, through the canton San Martino.
Chapels appearing through the green foliage; the
cupolas of family tombs; solitary cottages on the strand;
here and there a forsaken tower, in the rents of which the
wild fig-tree clings, while the cactus grows profusely at its
base,&mdash;make the country picturesque. The coast of Corsica is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
set round and round with these towers, which the Pisans and
Genoese built to ward off the piratical attacks of the Saracens.
They are round or square, built of brown granite, and stand
isolated. Their height is from thirty to fifty feet. A company
of watchers lay within, and alarmed the surrounding
country when the Corsairs approached. All these towers are
now forsaken, and gradually falling to ruin. They impart a
strangely romantic character to the Corsican shores.
</p>

<p>
It was pleasant to wander through this region in the radiant
morning; the eye embraced the prospect seawards, with the
fine forms of the islands of Elba, Capraja, and Monte Cisto,
and was again relieved by the mountains and valleys descending
close to the shore. The heights here enclose, like sides of
an amphitheatre, little, blooming, shady dales, watered by
noisy brooks. Scattered round, in a rude circle, stand the
black villages, with their tall church-towers and old cloisters.
On the meadows are herdsmen with their herds, and where
the valley opens to the sea, always a tower and a solitary
hamlet by the shore, with a boat or two in its little haven.
</p>

<p>
Every morning at sunrise, troops of women and girls may
be seen coming from Cape Corso to Bastia, with produce for
the market. They have a pretty blue or brown dress for the
town, and a clean handkerchief wound as mandile round the
hair. These forms moving along the shore through the
bright morning, with their neat baskets, full of laughing,
golden fruit, enliven the way very agreeably; and perhaps
it would be difficult to find anything more graceful than one
of those slender, handsome girls pacing towards you, light-footed
and elastic as a Hebe, with her basket of grapes on her
head. They are all in lively talk with their neighbours as
they pass, and all give you the same beautiful, light-hearted
<span lang='it_IT'><i>Evviva</i></span>. Nothing better certainly can one mortal wish another
than that he should <i>live</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But now forward, for the sun is in Leo, and in two hours
he will be fierce. And behind the Tower of Miomo, towards
the second pieve of Brando, the road ceases, and we must
climb like the goat, for there are few districts in Cape Corso
supplied with anything but footpaths. From the shore, at
the lonely little Marina di Basina, I began to ascend the hills,
on which lie the three communes that form the pieve of
Brando. The way was rough and steep, but cheered by
gushing brooks and luxuriant gardens. The slopes are quite
covered with these, and they are full of grapes, oranges, and
olives&mdash;fruits in which Brando specially abounds. The fig-tree
bends low its laden branches, and holds its ripe fruit
steadily to the parched mouth, unlike the tree of Tantalus.
</p>

<p>
On a declivity towards the sea, is the beautiful stalactite
cavern of Brando, not long since discovered. It lies in the
gardens of a retired officer. An emigrant of Modena had
given me a letter for this gentleman, and I called on him at
his mansion. The grounds are magnificent. The Colonel has
transformed the whole shore into a garden, which hangs above
the sea, dreamy and cool with silent olives, myrtles, and laurels;
there are cypresses and pines, too, isolated or in groups,
flowers everywhere, ivy on the walls, vine-trellises heavy with
grapes, oranges tree on tree, a little summer-house hiding
among the greenery, a cool grotto deep under ground, loneliness,
repose, a glimpse of emerald sky, and the sea with its
hermit islands, a glimpse into your own happy human heart;&mdash;it
were hard to tell when it might be best to live here, when
you are still young, or when you have grown old.
</p>

<p>
An elderly gentleman, who was looking out of the villa,
heard me ask the gardener for the Colonel, and beckoned me
to come to him. His garden had already shown me what
kind of a man he was, and the little room into which I now
entered told his character more and more plainly. The walls
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
were covered with symbolic paintings; the different professions
were fraternizing in a group, in which a husbandman, a
soldier, a priest, and a scholar, were shaking hands; the five
races were doing the same in another picture, where a European,
an Asiatic, a Moor, an Australian, and a Redskin, sat
sociably drinking round a table, encircled by a gay profusion of
curling vine-wreaths. I immediately perceived that I was in
the beautiful land of Icaria, and that I had happened on no
other personage than the excellent uncle of Goethe's Wanderjahre.
And so it was. He was the uncle&mdash;a bachelor, a
humanistic socialist, who, as country gentleman and land-owner,
diffused widely around him the beneficial influences
of his own great though noiseless activity.
</p>

<p>
He came towards me with a cheerful, quiet smile, the
<span lang='fr_FR'><i>Journal des Débats</i></span> in his hand, pleased apparently with what
he had been reading in it.
</p>

<p>
"I have read in your garden and in your room, signore,
the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>Contrat Social</i></span> of Rousseau, and some of the <i>Republic</i> of
Plato. You show me that you are the countryman of the
great Pasquale."
</p>

<p>
We talked long on a great variety of subjects&mdash;on civilisation
and on barbarism, and how impotent theory was proving
itself. But these are old affairs, that every reflecting man has
thought of and talked about.
</p>

<p>
Much musing on this interview, I went down to the grotto
after taking leave of the singular man, who had realized for
me so unexpectedly the creation of the poet. After all, this is
a strange island. Yesterday a bandit who has murdered ten
men out of <span lang='it_IT'><i>capriccio</i></span>, and is being led to the scaffold; to-day a
practical philosopher, and philanthropic advocate of universal
brotherhood&mdash;both equally genuine Corsicans, their history and
character the result of the history of their nation. As I passed
under the fair trees of the garden, however, I said to myself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
that it was not difficult to be a philanthropist in paradise. I
believe that the wonderful power of early Christianity arose
from the circumstance that its teachers were poor, probably
unfortunate men.
</p>

<p>
There is a Corsican tradition that St. Paul landed on Cape
Corso&mdash;the Promontorium Sacrum, as it was called in ancient
times&mdash;and there preached the gospel. It is certain that Cape
Corso was the district of the island into which Christianity
was first introduced. The little region, therefore, has long
been sacred to the cause of philanthropy and human progress.
</p>

<p>
The daughter of one of the gardeners led me to the grotto.
It is neither very high nor very deep, and consists of a
series of chambers, easily traversed. Lamps hung from the
roof. The girl lighted them, and left me alone. And now
a pale twilight illuminated this beautiful crypt, of such bizarre
stalactite formations as only a Gothic architect could
imagine&mdash;in pointed arches, pillar-capitals, domed niches, and
rosettes. The grottos of Corsica are her oldest Gothic
churches, for Nature built them in a mood of the most playful
fantasy. As the lamps glimmered, and shone on, and shone
through, the clear yellow stalactite, the cave was completely
like the crypt of some cathedral. Left in this twilight, I had
the following little fantasy in stalactite&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A wondrous maiden sat wrapped in a white veil on a throne
of the clearest alabaster. She never moved. She wore on
her head a lotos-flower, and on her breast a carbuncle. The
eye could not cease to gaze on the veiled maiden, for she
stirred a longing in the bosom. Before her kneeled many
little gnomes; the poor fellows were all of dropstone, all
stalactites, and they wore little yellow crowns of the fairest
alabaster. They never moved; but they all held their hands
stretched out towards the white maiden, as if they wished to
lift her veil, and bitter drops were falling from their eyes. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
seemed to me as if I knew some of them, and as if I must call
them by their names. "This is the goddess Isis," said the
toad sneeringly; she was sitting on a stone, and, I think,
threw a spell on them all with her eyes. "He who does not
know the right word, and cannot raise the veil of the beautiful
maiden, must weep himself to stone like these. Stranger,
wilt thou say the word?"
</p>

<p>
I was just falling asleep&mdash;for I was very tired, and the grotto
was so dim and cool, and the drops tinkled so slowly and
mournfully from the roof&mdash;when the gardener's daughter entered,
and said: "It is time!" "Time! to raise the veil of
Isis?&mdash;O ye eternal gods!" "Yes, Signore, to come out to
the garden and the bright sun." I thought she said well,
and I immediately followed her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see this firelock, Signore? We found it in the
grotto, quite coated with the dropstone, and beside it were
human bones; likely they were the bones and gun of a bandit;
the poor wretch had crept into this cave, and died in it like a
wounded deer." Nothing was now left of the piece but the
rusty barrel. It may have sped the avenging bullet into more
than one heart. Now I hold it in my hand like some fossil
of horrid history, and it opens its mouth and tells me stories
of the Vendetta.

<p>
I now descended to Erba Lunga, an animated little coast
village, which sends fishing-boats daily to Bastia. The oppressive
heat compelled me to rest here for some hours.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This was once the seat of the most powerful seigniors of
Cape Corso, and above Erba Lunga stands the old castle of
the Signori dei Gentili. The Gentili, with the Seigniors da
Mare, were masters of the Cape. The neighbouring island
of Capraja also belonged to the latter family. Oppressively
treated by its violent and unscrupulous owners, the inhabitants
rebelled in 1507, and placed themselves under the Bank of
Genoa. Cape Corso was always, from its position, considered
as inclining to Genoa, and its people were held to be unwarlike.
Even at the present day the men of the Corsican highlands
look down on the gentle and industrious people of the
peninsula with contempt. The historian Filippini says of
the Cape Corsicans: "The inhabitants of Cape Corso clothe
themselves well, and are, on account of their trade and their
vicinity to the Continent, much more domestic than the other
Corsicans. Great justice, truth, and honour, prevail among
them. All their industry is in wine, which they export to
the Continent." Even in Filippini's time, therefore, the wine
of Cape Corso was in reputation. It is mostly white; the
vintage of Luri and Rogliano is said to be the best; this wine
is among the finest that Southern Europe produces, and resembles
the Spanish, the Syracusan, and the Cyprian. But
Cape Corso is also rich in oranges and lemons.
</p>

<p>
If you leave the sea and go higher up the hills, you lose
all the beauty of this interesting little wine-country, for it
nestles low in the valleys. The whole of Cape Corso is a
system of such valleys on both its coasts; but the dividing
ranges are rugged and destitute of shade; their low wood
gives no shelter from the sun. Limestone, serpentine, talc,
and porphyry, show themselves. After a toilsome journey, I
at length arrived late in the evening in the valley of Sisco.
A paesane had promised me hospitality there, and I descended
into the valley rejoicing in the prospect. But which was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
commune of Sisco? All around at the foot of the hills, and
higher up, stood little black villages, the whole of them comprehended
under the name Sisco. Such is the Corsican custom,
to give all the hamlets of a valley the name of the pieve,
although each has its own particular appellation. I directed
my course to the nearest village, whither an old cloister
among pines attracted me, and seemed to say: Pilgrim, come,
have a draught of good wine. But I was deceived, and I had
to continue climbing for an hour, before I discovered my host
of Sisco. The little village lay picturesquely among wild
black rocks, a furious stream foaming through its midst, and
Monte Stello towering above it.
</p>

<p>
I was kindly received by my friend and his wife, a newly
married couple, and found their house comfortable. A number
of Corsicans came in with their guns from the hills, and
a little company of country-people was thus formed. The
women did not mingle with us; they prepared the meal,
served, and disappeared. We conversed agreeably till bedtime.
The people of Sisco are poor, but hospitable and
friendly. On the morrow, my entertainer awoke me with the
sun; he took me out before his house, and then gave me in
charge to an old man, who was to guide me through the
labyrinthine hill-paths to the right road for Crosciano. I
had several letters with me for other villages of the Cape,
given me by a Corsican the evening before. Such is the
beautiful and praiseworthy custom in Corsica; the hospitable
entertainer gives his departing guest a letter, commending
him to his relations or friends, who in their turn receive him
hospitably, and send him away with another letter. For
days thus you travel as guest, and are everywhere made much
of; as inns in these districts are almost unknown, travelling
would otherwise be an impossibility.
</p>

<p>
Sisco has a church sacred to Saint Catherine, which is of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
great antiquity, and much resorted to by pilgrims. It lies
high up on the shore. Once a foreign ship had been driven
upon these coasts, and had vowed relics to the church for its
rescue; which relics the mariners really did consecrate to the
holy Saint Catherine. They are highly singular relics, and
the folk of Sisco may justly be proud of possessing such
remarkable articles, as, for example, a piece of the clod of
earth from which Adam was modelled, a few almonds from
the garden of Eden, Aaron's rod that blossomed, a piece of
manna, a piece of the hairy garment of John the Baptist, a
piece of Christ's cradle, a piece of the rod on which the sponge
dipped in vinegar was raised to Christ's lips, and the celebrated
rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
Picturesque views abound in the hills of Sisco, and the
country becomes more and more beautiful as we advance
northwards. I passed through a great number of villages&mdash;Crosciano,
Pietra, Corbara, Cagnano&mdash;on the slopes of Monte
Alticcione, but I found some of them utterly poverty-stricken;
even their wine was exhausted. As I had refused breakfast in
the house of my late entertainer, in order not to send the good
people into the kitchen by sunrise, and as it was now mid-day,
I began to feel unpleasantly hungry. There were neither
figs nor walnuts by the wayside, and I determined that, happen
what might, I would satisfy my craving in the next paese.
In three houses they had nothing&mdash;not wine, not bread&mdash;all
their stores were expended. In the fourth, I heard the sound
of a guitar. I entered. Two gray-haired men in ragged
<i>blouses</i> were sitting, the one on the bed, the other on a stool.
He who sat on the bed held his <span lang='it_IT'><i>cetera</i></span>, or cithern, in his arm,
and played, while he seemed lost in thought. Perhaps he
was dreaming of his vanished youth. He rose, and opening
a wooden chest, brought out a half-loaf carefully wrapped in
a cloth, and handed me the bread that I might cut some of it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
for myself. Then he sat down again on the bed, played his
cithern, and sang a <span lang='it_IT'><i>vocero</i></span>, or dirge. As he sang, I ate the
bread of the bitterest poverty, and it seemed to me as if I
had found the old harper of <span lang='de_DE'><i>Wilhelm Meister</i></span>, and that he
sung to me the song&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Heaven knows how Goethe has got to Corsica, but this is
the second of his characters I have fallen in with on this
wild cape.
</p>

<p>
Having here had my hunger stilled, and something more,
I wandered onwards. As I descended into the vale of Luri,
the region around me, I found, had become a paradise. Luri
is the loveliest valley in Cape Corso, and also the largest,
though it is only ten kilometres long, and five broad.<a name='FA_G' id='FA_G' href='#FN_G' class='fnanchor'>[G]</a> Inland
it is terminated by beautiful hills, on the highest of
which stands a black tower. This is the tower of Seneca, so
called because, according to the popular tradition, it was here
that Seneca spent his eight years of Corsican exile. Towards
the sea, the valley slopes gently down to the marina of Luri.
A copious stream waters the whole dale, and is led in canals
through the gardens. Here lie the communes which form the
pieve of Luri, rich, and comfortable-looking, with their tall
churches, cloisters, and towers, in the midst of a vegetation of
tropical luxuriance. I have seen many a beautiful valley in
Italy, but I remember none that wore a look so laughing and
winsome as that fair vale of Luri. It is full of vineyards,
covered with oranges and lemons, rich in fruit-trees of every
kind, in melons, and all sorts of garden produce, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
higher you ascend, the denser become the groves of chestnuts,
walnuts, figs, almonds, and olives.

PINO.
</h3>

<p>
A good road leads upwards from the marina of Luri. You
move in one continual garden&mdash;in an atmosphere of balsamic
fragrance. Cottages approaching the elegant style of Italian
villas indicate wealth. How happy must the people be here,
if their own passions deal as gently with them as the elements.
A man who was dressing his vineyard saw me passing along,
and beckoned me to come in, and I needed no second bidding.
Here is the place for swinging the thyrsus-staff; no grape disease
here&mdash;everywhere luscious maturity and joyous plenty.
The wine of Luri is beautiful, and the citrons of this valley
are said to be the finest produced in the countries of the
Mediterranean. It is the thick-skinned species of citrons
called <span lang='it_IT'><i>cedri</i></span> which is here cultivated; they are also produced
in abundance all along the west coast, but more especially
in Centuri. The tree, which is extremely tender, demands
the utmost attention. It thrives only in the warmest exposures,
and in the valleys which are sheltered from the Libeccio.
Cape Corso is the very Elysium of this precious tree of the
Hesperides.
</p>

<p>
I now began to cross the Serra towards Pino, which lies at
its base on the western side. My path lay for a long time
through woods of walnut-trees, the fruit of which was already
ripe; and I must here confirm what I had heard, that the
nut-trees of Corsica will not readily find their equals. Fig-trees,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
olives, chestnuts, afford variety at intervals. It is pleasant
to wander through the deep shades of a northern forest
of beeches, oaks, or firs, but the forests of the south are no
less glorious; walking beneath these trees one feels himself
in noble company. I ascended towards the Tower of Fondali,
which lies near the little village of the same name, quite
overshadowed with trees, and finely relieving their rich deep
green. From its battlements you look down over the beautiful
valley to the blue sea, and above you rise the green hills,
summit over summit, with forsaken black cloisters on them;
on the highest rock of the Serra is seen the Tower of Seneca,
which, like a stoic standing wrapt in deep thought, looks
darkly down over land and sea. The many towers that stand
here&mdash;for I counted numbers of them&mdash;indicate that this valley
of Luri was richly cultivated, even in earlier times; they
were doubtless built for its protection. Even Ptolemy is acquainted
with the Vale of Luri, and in his Geography calls it
Lurinon.
</p>

<p>
I climbed through a shady wood and blooming wilderness
of trailing plants to the ridge of the Serra, close beneath the
foot of the cone on which the Tower of Seneca stands. From
this point both seas are visible, to the right and to the left.
I now descended towards Pino, where I was expected by some
Carrarese statuaries. The view of the western coast with its
red reefs and little rocky zig-zag coves, and of the richly
wooded pieve of Pino, came upon me with a most agreeable
surprise. Pino has some large turreted mansions lying in
beautiful parks; they might well serve for the residence of
any Roman Duca:&mdash;for Corsica has its <i>millionnaires</i>. On
the Cape live about two hundred families of large means&mdash;some
of these possessed of quite enormous wealth, gained
either by themselves or by relations, in the Antilles, Mexico,
and Brazil.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One fortunate Cr&oelig;sus of Pino inherited from an uncle of his
in St. Thomas a fortune of ten millions of francs. Uncles are
most excellent individuals. To have an uncle is to have a
constant stake in the lottery. Uncles can make anything of
their nephews&mdash;<i>millionnaires</i>, immortal historical personages.
The nephew of Pino has rewarded his meritorious relative
with a mausoleum of Corsican marble&mdash;a pretty Moorish
family tomb on a hill by the sea. It was on this building
my Carrarese friends were engaged.
</p>

<p>
In the evening we paid a visit to the Curato. We found
him walking before his beautifully-situated parsonage, in the
common brown Corsican jacket, and with the Phrygian cap
of liberty on his head. The hospitable gentleman led us into
his parlour. He seated himself in his arm-chair, ordered the
Donna to bring wine, and, when the glasses came in, reached
his cithern from the wall. Then he began with all the heartiness
in the world to play and sing the Paoli march. The
Corsican clergy were always patriotic men, and in many
battles fought in the ranks with their parishioners. The parson
of Pino now put his Mithras-cap to rights, and began a
serenade to the beautiful Marie. I shook him heartily by the
hand, thanked him for wine and song, and went away to the
paese where I was to lodge for the night. Next morning
we proposed wandering a while longer in Pino, and then to
visit Seneca in his tower.
</p>

<p>
On this western coast of Cape Corso, below Pino, lies the
fifth and last pieve of the Cape, called Nonza. Near Nonza
stands the tower which I mentioned in the History of the
Corsicans, when recording an act of heroic patriotism. There
is another intrepid deed connected with it. In the year 1768
it was garrisoned by a handful of militia, under the command
of an old captain, named Casella. The French were already
in possession of the Cape, all the other captains having capitulated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
Casella refused to follow their example. The tower
mounted one cannon; they had plenty of ammunition, and
the militia had their muskets. This was sufficient, said the
old captain, to defend the place against a whole army; and if
matters came to the worst, then you could blow yourself up.
The militia knew their man, and that he was in the habit of
doing what he said. They accordingly took themselves off
during the night, leaving their muskets, and the old captain
found himself alone. He concluded, therefore, to defend the
tower himself. The cannon was already loaded; he charged
all the pieces, distributed them over the various shot-holes,
and awaited the French. They came, under the command of
General Grand-Maison. As soon as they were within range,
Casella first discharged the cannon at them, and then made a
diabolical din with the muskets. The French sent a flag of
truce to the tower, with the information that the entire Cape
had surrendered, and summoning the commandant to do the
same with all his garrison, and save needless bloodshed.
Hereupon Casella replied that he would hold a council
of war, and retired. After some time he reappeared and announced
that the garrison of Nonza would capitulate under
condition that it should be allowed to retire with the honours
of war, and with all its baggage and artillery, for which the
French were to furnish conveyances. The conditions were
agreed to. The French had drawn up before the tower, and
were now ready to receive the garrison, when old Casella
issued, with his firelock, his pistols, and his sabre. The
French waited for the garrison, and, surprised that the men
did not make their appearance, the officer in command asked
why they were so long in coming out. "They <i>have</i> come
out," answered the Corsican; "for I am the garrison of the
Tower of Nonza." The duped officer became furious, and
rushed upon Casella. The old man drew his sword, and stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
on the defensive. In the meantime, Grand-Maison himself
hastened up, and, having heard the story, was sufficiently
astonished. He instantly put his officer under strict arrest,
and not only fulfilled every stipulation of Casella's to the letter,
but sent him with a guard of honour, and a letter expressive
of his admiration, to Paoli's head-quarters.
</p>

<p>
Above Pino extends the canton of Rogliano, with Ersa and
Centuri&mdash;a district of remarkable fertility in wine, oil, and
lemons, and rivalling Luri in cultivation. The five pievi of
the entire Cape&mdash;Brando, Martino, Luri, Rogliano, and Nonza&mdash;contain
twenty-one communes, and about 19,000 inhabitants;
almost as many, therefore, as the island of Elba. Going
northwards, from Rogliano over Ersa, you reach the extreme
northern point of Corsica, opposite to which, with a lighthouse
on it, lies the little island of Girolata.

<p>
The Tower of Seneca can be seen at sea, and from a distance
of many miles. It stands on a gigantic, quite naked
mass of granite, which rises isolated from the mountain-ridge,
and bears on its summit the black weather-beaten pile. The
ruin consists of a single round tower&mdash;lonely and melancholy
it stands there, hung with hovering mists, all around bleak
heath-covered hills, the sea on both sides deep below.
</p>

<p>
If, as imaginative tradition affirms, the banished stoic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'>[213]</a></span>
spent eight years of exile here, throning among the clouds, in
the silent rocky wilds&mdash;then he had found a place not ill adapted
for a philosopher disposed to make wise reflections on
the world and fate; and to contemplate with wonder and reverence
the workings of the eternal elements of nature. The
genius of Solitude is the wise man's best instructor; in still
night hours he may have given Seneca insight into the world's
transitoriness, and shown him the vanity of great Rome, when
the exile was inclined to bewail his lot. After Seneca returned
from his banishment to Rome, he sometimes, perhaps, among
the abominations of the court of Nero, longed for the solitary
days of Corsica. There is an old Roman tragedy called
<i>Octavia</i>, the subject of which is the tragic fate of Nero's first
empress.<a name='FA_H' id='FA_H' href='#FN_H' class='fnanchor'>[H]</a> In this tragedy Seneca appears as the moralizing
figure, and on one occasion delivers himself as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"O Lady Fortune, with the flattering smile</p>
<p>
On thy deceitful face, why hast thou raised</p>
<p>
One so contented with his humble lot</p>
<p>
To height so giddy? Wheresoe'er I look,</p>
<p>
Terrors around me threaten, and at last</p>
<p>
The deeper fall is sure. Ah, happier far&mdash;</p>
<p>
Safe from the ills of envy once I hid&mdash;</p>
<p>
Among the rocks of sea-girt Corsica.</p>
<p>
I was my own; my soul was free from care,</p>
<p>
In studious leisure lightly sped the hours.</p>
<p>

<p>

The seasonable change of morn and eve,</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>
A rude sheep-track led us up the mountain over shattered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>[214]</a></span>
rocks. Half-way up to the tower, completely hidden among
crags and bushes, lies a forsaken Franciscan cloister. The
shepherds and the wild fig-tree now dwell in its halls, and the
raven croaks the <span lang='la'><i>de profundis</i></span>. But the morning and the
evening still come there to hold their silent devotions, and
kindle incense of myrtle, mint, and cytisus. What a fragrant
breath of herbs is about us! what morning stillness on the
mountains and the sea!
</p>

<p>
We stood on the Tower of Seneca. We had clambered on
hands and feet to reach its walls. By holding fast to projecting
ledges and hanging perilously over the abyss, you can
gain a window. There is no other entrance into the tower;
its outer works are destroyed, but the remains show that a
castle, either of the seigniors of Cape Corso or of the Genoese,
stood here. The tower is built of astonishingly firm material;
its battlements, however, are rent and dilapidated. It is unlikely
that Seneca lived on this Aornos, this height forsaken
by the very birds, and certainly too lofty a flight for moral
philosophers&mdash;a race that love the levels. Seneca probably
lived in one of the Roman colonies, Aleria or Mariana, where
the stoic, accustomed to the conveniences of Roman city life,
may have established himself comfortably in some house near
the sea; so that the favourite mullet and tunny had not far
to travel from the strand to his table.
</p>

<p>
A picture from the fearfully beautiful world of imperial
Rome passed before me as I sat on Seneca's tower. Who can
say he rightly and altogether comprehends this world? It
often seems to me as if it were Hades, and as if the whole human
race of the period were holding in its obscure twilight a
great diabolic carnival of fools, dancing a gigantic, universal
ballet before the Emperor's throne, while the Emperor sits
there gloomy as Pluto, only breaking out now and then into
insane laughter; for it is the maddest carnival this; old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
Seneca plays in it too, among the Pulcinellos, and appears in
character with his bathing-tub.
</p>

<p>
Even a Seneca may have something tragi-comic about
him, if we think of him, for example, in the pitiably ludicrous
shape in which he is represented in the old statue that bears
his name. He stands there naked, a cloth about his loins, in
the bath in which he means to die, a sight heart-rending to
behold, with his meagre form so tremulous about the knees,
and his face so unutterably wo-begone. He resembles one
of the old pictures of St. Jerome, or some starveling devotee
attenuated by penance; he is tragi-comic, provocative of
laughter no less than pity, as many of the representations of
the old martyrs are, the form of their suffering being usually
so whimsical.
</p>

<p>
Seneca was born, <span class="s08">B.C.</span> 3, at Cordova, in Spain, of equestrian
family. His mother, Helvia, was a woman of unusual ability;
his father, Lucius Annæus, a rhetorician of note, who removed
with his family to Rome. In the time of Caligula, Seneca
the younger distinguished himself as an orator, and Stoic
philosopher of extraordinary learning. A remarkably good
memory had been of service to him. He himself relates that
after hearing two thousand names once repeated, he could
repeat them again in the same order, and that he had no difficulty
in doing the same with two hundred verses.
</p>

<p>
In favour at the court of Claudius, he owed his fall to Messalina.
She accused him of an intrigue with the notorious
Julia, the daughter of Germanicus, and the most profligate
woman in Rome. The imputation is doubly comical, as
coming from a Messalina, and because it makes us think of
Seneca the moralist as a Don Juan. It is hard to say how
much truth there is in the scandalous story, but Rome was a
strange place, and nothing can be more bizarre than some of
the characters it produced. Julia was got out of the way,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
and Don Juan Seneca sent into banishment among the barbarians
of Corsica. The philosopher now therefore became,
without straining the word, a Corsican bandit.
</p>

<p>
There was in those days no more terrible punishment than
that of exile, because expulsion from Rome was banishment
from the world. Eight long years Seneca lived on the wild
island. I cannot forgive my old friend, therefore, for recording
nothing about its nature, about the history and condition
of its inhabitants, at that period. A single chapter from the
pen of Seneca on these subjects, would now be of great value
to us. But to have said nothing about the barbarous country
of his exile, was very consistent with his character as Roman.
Haughty, limited, void of sympathetic feeling for his kind,
was the man of those times. How different is the relation in
which we now stand to nature and history!
</p>

<p>
For the banished Seneca the island was merely a prison
that he detested. The little that he says about it in his book
<span lang='la'><i>De Consolatione ad Matrem Helviam</i></span>, shows how little he
knew of it. For though it was no doubt still more rude and
uncultivated than at present, its natural grandeur was the
same. He composed the following epigrams on Corsica, which
are to be found in his poetical works:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Corsican isle, where his town the Phocæan colonist planted,</p>
<p>
Corsica, called by the Greeks Cyrnus in earlier days,</p>
<p>
Corsica, less than thy sister Sardinia, longer than Elba,</p>
<p>
Corsica, traversed by streams&mdash;streams that the fisherman loves,</p>

The second has been said to be spurious, but I do not see
why our heart-broken exile should not have been its author,
as well as any of his contemporaries or successors in Corsican
banishment.

<p>
The Corsicans have not failed to take revenge on Seneca.
Since he gives them and their country such a disgraceful character,
they have connected a scandalous story with his name.
Popular tradition has preserved only a single incident from
the period of his residence in Corsica, and it is as follows:&mdash;As
Seneca sat in his tower and looked down into the frightful
island, he saw the Corsican virgins, that they were fair.
Thereupon the philosopher descended, and he dallied with
the daughters of the land. One comely shepherdess did he
honour with his embrace; but the kinsfolk of the maiden
came upon him suddenly, and took him, and scourged the
philosopher with nettles.
</p>

<p>
Ever since, the nettle grows profusely and ineradicably
round the Tower of Seneca, as a warning to moral philosophers.
The Corsicans call it <i>Ortica de Seneca</i>.
</p>

<p>
Unhappy Seneca! He is always getting into tragi-comic
situations. A Corsican said to me: "You have read what
Seneca says of us? <span lang='it_IT'><i>ma era un birbone</i></span>&mdash;but he was a great
rascal." <span lang='it_IT'><i>Seneca morale</i></span>, says Dante,&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>Seneca birbone</i></span>, says
the Corsican&mdash;another instance of his love for his country.
</p>

<p>
Other sighs of exile did the unfortunate philosopher breathe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
out in verse&mdash;some epigrams to his friends, one on his native
city of Cordova. If Seneca wrote any of the tragedies which
bear his name in Corsica, it must certainly have been the
Medea. Where could he have found a locality more likely to
have inspired him to write on a subject connected with the
Argonauts, than this sea-girt island? Here he might well
make his chorus sing those remarkable verses which predict
Columbus:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"A time shall come</p>
<p>
In the late ages,</p>
<p>
When Ocean shall loosen</p>
<p>
The bonds of things;</p>
<p>
Open and vast</p>
<p>
Then lies the earth;</p>
<p>
Then shall Tiphys</p>
<p>
New worlds disclose.</p>
<p>
And Thule no more</p>
<p>
Be the farthest land."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Now the great navigator Columbus was born in the Genoese
territory, not far from Corsica. The Corsicans will have it
that he was born in Calvi, in Corsica itself, and they maintain
this till the present day.

Fair fruits grew for Seneca in his exile; and perhaps he
owed some of his exalted philosophy rather to his Corsican
solitude than to the teachings of an Attalus or a Socio. In
the Letter of Consolation to his mother, he writes thus at the
close:&mdash;You must believe me happy and cheerful, as when in
prosperity. That is true prosperity when the mind devotes
itself to its pursuits without disturbing thoughts, and, now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
pleasing itself with lighter studies, now thirsting after truth,
elevates itself to the contemplation of its own nature and of
that of the universe. First, it investigates the countries and
their situations, then the nature of the circumfluent sea,
and its changes of ebb and flow; then it contemplates the
terrible powers that lie between heaven and earth&mdash;the thunder,
lightnings, winds, rain, snow and hail, that disquiet this
space; at last, when it has wandered through the lower regions,
it takes its flight to the highest, and enjoys the beautiful
spectacle of celestial things, and, mindful of its own
eternity, enters into all which has been and shall be to all
eternity.
</p>

<p>
When I took up Seneca's Letter of Consolation to his
mother, I was not a little curious to see how he would
console her. How would one of the thousand cultivated exiles
scattered over the world at the present time console <i>his</i>
mother? Seneca's letter is a quite methodically arranged
treatise, consisting of seventeen chapters. It is a more than
usually instructive contribution to the psychology of these old
Stoics. The son is not so particularly anxious to console his
mother as to write an excellent and elegant treatise, the logic
and style of which shall procure him admiration. He is quite
proud that his treatise will be a species of composition hitherto
unknown in the world of letters. The vain man writes to his
mother like an author to a critic with whom he is coolly discussing
the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of his subject. I have, says he,
consulted all the works of the great geniuses who have written
upon the methods of moderating grief, but I have found
no example of any one's consoling his friends when it was
himself they were lamenting. In this new case, therefore, in
which I found myself, I was embarrassed, and feared lest I
might open the wounds instead of healing them. Must not a
man who raises his head from the funeral-pile itself to comfort
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
his relatives, need new words, such as the common language
of daily life does not supply him with? Every great
and unusual sorrow must make its own selection of words, if
it does not refuse itself language altogether. I shall venture
to write to you, therefore, not in confidence on my talent, but
because I myself, the consoler, am here to serve as the most
effectual consolation. For your son's sake, to whom you can
deny nothing, you will not, as I trust (though all grief is
stubborn), refuse to permit bounds to be set to your grief.
</p>

<p>
He now begins to console after his new fashion, reckoning
up to his mother all that she has already suffered, and drawing
the conclusion that she must by this time have become
callous. Throughout the whole treatise you hear the skeleton
of the arrangement rattling. Firstly, his mother is not
to grieve on his account; secondly, his mother is not to grieve
on her own account. The letter is full of the most beautiful
stoical contempt of the world.
</p>

<p>
"Yet it is a terrible thing to be deprived of one's country."
What is to be said to this?&mdash;Mother, consider the vast multitude
of people in Rome; the greater number of them have
congregated there from all parts of the world. One is driven
from home by ambition, another by business of state, by an
embassy, by the quest of luxury, by vice, by the wish to
study, by the desire of seeing the spectacles, by friendship, by
speculation, by eloquence, by beauty. Then, leaving Rome
out of view, which indeed is to be considered the mother-city
of them all, go to other cities, go to islands, come here to Corsica&mdash;everywhere
are more strangers than natives. "For to
man is given a desire of movement and of change, because he
is moved by the celestial Spirit; consider the heavenly luminaries
that give light to the world&mdash;none of them remains
fixed&mdash;they wander ceaselessly on their path, and change perpetually
their place." His poetic vein gave Seneca this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
fine thought. Our well-known wanderer's song has the
words&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
"Fix'd in the heavens the sun does not stand,</p>
<p>
He travels o'er sea, he travels o'er land."<a name='FA_K' id='FA_K' href='#FN_K' class='fnanchor'>[K]</a></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
"Varro, the most learned of the Romans," continues Seneca,
"considers it the best compensation for the change of dwelling-place,
that the nature of things is everywhere the same.
Marcus Brutus finds sufficient consolation in the fact that he
who goes into exile can take all that he has of truly good
with him. Is not what we lose a mere trifle? Wherever we
turn, two glorious things go with us&mdash;Nature that is everywhere,
and Virtue that is our own. Let us travel through all
possible countries, and we shall find no part of the earth which
man cannot make his home. Everywhere the eye can rise to
heaven, and all the divine worlds are at an equal distance
from all the earthly. So long, therefore, as my eyes are not
debarred that spectacle, with seeing which they are never
satisfied; so long as I can behold moon and sun; so long as
my gaze can rest on the other celestial luminaries; so long
as I can inquire into their rising and setting, their courses,
and the causes of their moving faster or slower; so long as
I can contemplate the countless stars of night, and mark how
some are immoveable&mdash;how others, not hastening through
large spaces, circle in their own path, how many beam forth
with a sudden brightness, many blind the eye with a stream
of fire as if they fell, others pass along the sky in a long train
of light; so long as I am with these, and dwell, as much as
it is allowed to mortals, in heaven; so long as I can maintain
my soul, which strives after the contemplation of natures related
to it, in the pure ether, of what importance to me is the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
soil on which my foot treads? This island bears no fruitful
nor pleasant trees; it is not watered by broad and navigable
streams; it produces nothing that other nations can desire;
it is hardly fertile enough to supply the necessities of the inhabitants;
no precious stone is here hewn (<span lang='la'><i>non pretiosus lapis
hic cæditur</i></span>); no veins of gold or silver are here brought to
light; but the soul is narrow that delights itself with what is
earthly. It must be guided to that which is everywhere the
same, and nowhere loses its splendour."
</p>

<p>
Had I Humboldt's <i>Cosmos</i> at hand, I should look whether
the great natural philosopher has taken notice of these lofty
periods of Seneca, where he treats of the sense of the ancients
for natural beauty.
</p>

<p>
This, too, is a spirited passage:&mdash;"The longer they build
their colonnades, the higher they raise their towers, the
broader they stretch their streets, the deeper they dig their
summer grottos, the more massively they pile their banqueting-halls&mdash;all
the more effectually they cover themselves from
the sky.&mdash;Brutus relates in his book on virtue, that he saw
Marcellus in exile in Mitylene, and that he lived, as far as
it was possible for human nature, in the enjoyment of the
greatest happiness, and never was more devoted to literature
than then. Hence, adds he, as he was to return without
him, it seemed to him that he was rather himself going into
exile than leaving the other in banishment behind him."
</p>

<p>
Now follows a panegyric on poverty and moderation, as
contrasted with the luxurious gluttony of the rich, who ransack
heaven and earth to tickle their palates, bring game
from Phasis, and fowls from Parthia, who vomit in order to
eat, and eat in order to vomit. "The Emperor Caligula," says
Seneca, "whom Nature seems to me to have produced to show
what the most degrading vice could do in the highest station, ate
a dinner one day, that cost ten million sesterces; and although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
I have had the aid of the most ingenious men, still I have
hardly been able to make out how the tribute of three provinces
could be transformed into a single meal." Like Rousseau,
Seneca preaches the return of men to the state of nature.
The times of the two moralists were alike; they themselves
resemble each other in weakness of character, though Seneca,
as compared with Rousseau, was a Roman and a hero.
</p>

<p>
Scipio's daughters received their dowries from the public
treasury, because their father left nothing behind him. "O
happy husbands of such maidens," cries Seneca; "husbands
to whom the Roman people was father-in-law! Are they
to be held happier whose ballet-dancers bring with them a
million sesterces as dowry?"
</p>

<p>
After Seneca has comforted his mother in regard to his
own sufferings, he proceeds to comfort her with reference to
herself. "You must not imitate the example," he writes to
her, "of women whose grief, when it had once mastered them,
ended only with death. You know many, who, after the loss
of their sons, never more laid off the robe of mourning that
they had put on. But your nature has ever been stronger
than this, and imposes upon you a nobler course. The excuse
of the weakness of the sex cannot avail for her who is
far removed from all female frailties. The most prevailing
evil of the present time&mdash;unchastity, has not ranked you with
the common crowd; neither precious stones nor pearls have
had power over you, and wealth, accounted the highest of
human blessings, has not dazzled you. The example of the
bad, which is dangerous even to the virtuous, has not contaminated
you&mdash;the strictly educated daughter of an ancient
and severe house. You were never ashamed of the number
of your children, as if they made you old before your time;
you never&mdash;like some whose beautiful form is their only recommendation&mdash;concealed
your fruitfulness, as if the burden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
were unseemly; nor did you ever destroy the hope of children
that had been conceived in your bosom. You never disfigured
your face with spangles or with paint; and never did
a garment please you, that had been made only to show
nakedness. Modesty appeared to you the alone ornament&mdash;the
highest and never-fading beauty!" So writes the son to
his mother, and it seems to me there is a most philosophical
want of affectation in his style.
</p>

<p>
He alludes to Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi; but he
does not conceal from himself that grief is a disobedient thing.
Traitorous tears, he knows, will appear on the face of assumed
serenity. "Sometimes," says Seneca, "we entangle the soul
in games and gladiator-shows; but even in the midst of such
spectacles, the remembrance of its loss steals softly upon it.
Therefore is it better to overcome than to deceive. For
when the heart has either been cheated by pleasure, or diverted
by business, it rebels again, and derives from repose
itself the force for new disquiet; but it is lastingly still if it
has yielded to reason." A wise man's voice enunciates here
simply and beautifully the alone right, but the bitterly difficult
rules for the art of life. Seneca, accordingly, counsels
his mother not to use the ordinary means for overcoming her
grief&mdash;a picturesque tour, or employment in household affairs;
he advises mental occupation, lamenting, at the same time,
that his father&mdash;an excellent man, but too much attached to
the customs of the ancients&mdash;never could prevail upon himself
to give her philosophical cultivation. Here we have an
amusing glimpse of the old Seneca, I mean of the father.
We know now how he looked. When the fashionable literary
ladies and gentlemen in Cordova, who had picked up
ideas about the rights of woman, and the elevation of her
social position, from the <i>Republic</i> of Plato, represented to the
old gentleman, that it were well if his young wife attended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
the lectures of some philosophers, he growled out: "Absurd
nonsense; my wife shall not have her head turned with your
high-flying notions, nor be one of your silly blue-stockings;
cook shall she, bear children, and bring up children!" So
said the worthy gentleman, and added, in excellent Spanish,
"Basta!"
</p>

<p>
Seneca now speaks at considerable length of the magnanimity
of which woman is capable, having no idea then that
he was yet, when dying, to experience the truth of what he
said, in the case of his own wife, Paulina. A noble man,
therefore, a stoic of exalted virtue, has addressed this Letter
of Consolation to Helvia. Is it possible that precisely the
same man can think and write like a crawling parasite&mdash;like
the basest flatterer?

<p>
Here is a second Letter of Consolation, which Seneca wrote
in the second or third year of his Corsican exile, to Polybius,
the freedman of Claudius, a courtier of the ordinary stamp.
Polybius served the over-learned Claudius as literary adviser,
and tormented himself with a Latin translation of Homer and
a Greek one of Virgil. The loss of his talented brother occasioned
Seneca's consolatory epistle to the courtier. He wrote
the treatise with the full consciousness that Polybius would
read it to the Emperor, and, not to miss the opportunity of
appeasing the wrath of Claudius, he made it a model of low
flattery of princes and their influential favourites. When we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>[226]</a></span>
read it, we must not forget what sort of men Claudius and
Polybius were.
</p>

<p>
"O destiny," cries the flatterer, "how cunningly hast thou
sought out the vulnerable spot! What was there to rob such
a man of? Money? He has always despised it. Life?
His genius makes him immortal. He has himself provided
that his better part shall endure, for his glorious rhetorical
works cannot fail to rescue him from the ordinary lot of
mortals. So long as literature is held in honour, so long as
the Latin language retains its vigour, or the Greek its grace,
so long shall he live with the greatest men, whose genius his
own equals, or, if his modesty would object to that, at least
approaches.&mdash;Unworthy outrage! Polybius mourns, Polybius
has an affliction, and the Emperor is gracious to him! By
this, inexorable destiny, thou wouldst, without doubt, show
that none can be shielded from thee, no, not even by the Emperor!
Yet, why does Polybius weep? Has he not his
beloved Emperor, who is dearer to him than life? So long
as it is well with him, then is it well with all who are yours,
then have you lost nothing, then must your eyes be not only
dry, but bright with joy. The Emperor is everything to you,
in him you have all that you can desire. To him, your
divinity, you must therefore raise your glance, and grief will
have no power over your soul.
</p>

<p>
"Destiny, withhold thy hand from the Emperor, and show
thy power only in blessing, letting him remain as a physician to
mankind, who have suffered now so long, that he may again
order and adjust what the madness of his predecessor destroyed.
May this star, which has arisen in its brightness on a world
plunged into abysses of darkness, shine evermore! May he
subdue Germany, open up Britain, and celebrate ancestral victories
and new triumphs, of which his clemency, which takes
the first place among his virtues, makes me hope that I too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
shall be a witness. For he did not so cast me down, that
he shall not again raise me up: no, it was not even he who
overthrew me; but when destiny gave me the thrust, and I
was falling, he broke my fall, and, gently intervening with
godlike hand, bore me to a place of safety. He raised his
voice for me in the senate, and not only gave me, but petitioned
for, my life. He will himself see how he has to judge
my cause; either his justice will recognise it as good, or his
clemency will make it so. The benefit will still be the same,
whether he perceives, or whether he wills, that I am innocent.
Meanwhile, it is a great consolation to me, in my wretchedness,
to see how his compassion travels through the whole
world; and as he has again brought back to the light, from
this corner in which I am buried, many who lay sunk in the
oblivion of a long banishment, I do not fear that he will forget
me. But he himself knows best the time for helping each.
Nothing shall be wanting on my part that he may not blush
to come at length to me. All hail to thy clemency, Cæsar!
thanks to which, exiles live more peacefully under thee than
the noblest of the people under Caius. They do not tremble,
they do not hourly expect the sword, they do not shudder to
see a ship coming. Through thee they have at once a goal to
their cruel fate, and the hope of a better future, and a peaceful
present. Surely the thunderbolts are altogether righteous
which even those worship whom they strike."
</p>

<p>
O nettles, more nettles, noble Corsicans,&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>era un birbone!</i></span>
</p>

<p>
The epistle concludes in these terms: "I have written this
to you as well as I could, with a mind grown languid and
dull through long inactivity; if it appears to you not worthy of
your genius, or to supply medicine too slight for your sorrow,
consider that the Latin word flows but reluctantly to his pen,
in whose ear the barbarians have long been dinning their
confused and clumsy jargon."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
His flattery did not avail the sorrow-laden exile, but
changes in the Roman court ended his banishment. The
head of Polybius had fallen. Messalina had been executed.
So stupid was Claudius, that he forgot the execution of his
wife, and some days after asked at supper why Messalina did
not come to table. Thus, all these horrors are dashed with
the tragi-comic. The best of comforters, the Corsican bandit,
returns. Agrippina, the new empress of Claudius, wishes
him to educate her son Nero, now eleven years old. Can
there be anything more tragi-comic than Seneca as tutor
to Nero? He came, thanking the gods that they had laid
upon him such a task as that of educating a boy to be
Emperor of the world. He expected now to fill the whole
earth with his own philosophy by infusing it into the young
Nero. What an undertaking&mdash;at once tragical and ridiculous&mdash;to
bring up a young tiger-cub on the principles of
the Stoics! For the rest, Seneca found in his hopeful pupil
the materials of the future man totally unspoiled by bungling
scholastic methods; for he had grown up in a most divine
ignorance, and, till his twelfth year, had enjoyed the tender
friendship of a barber, a coachman, and a rope-dancer. From
such hands did Seneca receive the boy who was destined to
rule over gods and men.
</p>

<p>
As Seneca was banished to Corsica in the first year of the
reign of Claudius, and returned in the eighth, he was privileged
to enjoy this "divinity and celestial star" for more
than five years. One day, however, Claudius died, for Agrippina
gave him poison in a pumpkin which served as drinking-cup.
The notorious Locusta had mixed the potion. The
death of Claudius furnished Seneca with the ardently longed
for opportunity of venting his revenge. Terribly did the philosopher
make the Emperor's memory suffer for that eight
years' banishment; he wrote on the dead man the satire, called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
the Apokolokyntosis&mdash;a pasquil of astonishing wit and almost
incredible coarseness, equalling the writings of Lucian in
sparkle and cleverness. The title is happy. The word, invented
for the nonce, parodies the notion of the apotheosis
of the Emperors, or their reception among the gods; and
would be literally translated Pumpkinification, or reception of
Claudius among the pumpkins. This satire should be read.
It is highly characteristic of the period of Roman history in
which it was written&mdash;a period when an utterly limitless
despotism nevertheless allowed of a man's using such daring
freedom of speech, and when an Emperor just dead could be
publicly ridiculed by his successor, his own family, and the
people, as a jack-pudding, without compromising the imperial
dignity. In this Roman world, all is ironic accident, fools'
carnival, tragi-comic, and bizarre.
</p>

<p>
Seneca speaks with all the freedom of a mask and as
Roman Pasquino, and thus commences&mdash;"What happened on
the 13th of October, in the consulship of Asinius Marcellus
and Acilius Aviola, in the first year of the new Emperor, at
the beginning of the period of blessing from heaven, I shall
now deliver to memory. And in what I have to say, neither
my vengeance nor my gratitude shall speak a word. If any
one asks me where I got such accurate information about
everything, I shall in the meantime not answer, if I don't
choose. Who shall compel me? Do I not know that I have
become a free man, since a certain person took his leave, who
verified the proverb&mdash;One must either be born a king or a
fool? And if I choose to answer, I shall say the first thing
that comes into my head." Seneca now affirms, sneeringly,
that he heard what he is about to relate from the senator
who saw Drusilla [sister and mistress of Caligula] ascend to
heaven from the Appian Way.<a name='FA_L' id='FA_L' href='#FN_L' class='fnanchor'>[L]</a> The same man had now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
according to the philosopher, been a witness of all that had
happened to Claudius on occasion of <i>his</i> ascension.
</p>

<p>
I shall be better understood, continued Seneca, if I say
it was on the 13th of October; the hour I am unable exactly
to fix, for there is still greater variance between the
clocks than between the philosophers. It was, however, between
the sixth and the seventh hour&mdash;Claudius was just
gasping for a little breath, and couldn't find any. Hereupon
Mercury, who had always been delighted with the genius of
the man, took one of the three Parcæ aside, and said&mdash;"Cruel
woman, why do you let the poor mortal torment himself so
long, since he has not deserved it? He has been gasping for
breath for sixty-four years now. What ails you at him?
Allow the mathematicians to be right at last, who, ever since
he became Emperor, have been assuring us of his death every
year, nay, every month. And yet it is no wonder if they
make mistakes. Nobody knows the man's hour&mdash;for nobody
has ever looked on him as born. Do your duty,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
Give him to death,</p>
<p>
And let a better fill his empty throne."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Atropos now cuts Claudius's thread of life; but Lachesis
spins another&mdash;a glittering thread, that of Nero; while Ph&oelig;bus
plays upon his lyre. In well-turned, unprincipled verses,
Seneca flatters his young pupil, his new sun&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Ph&oelig;bus the god hath said it; he shall pass</p>
<p>
Victoriously his mortal life, like me</p>
<p>
In countenance, and like me in my beauty;</p>
<p>
In song my rival, and in suasive speech.</p>
<p>
A happier age he bringeth to the weary,</p>
<p>
For he will break the silence of the laws.</p>
<p>
Like Phosphor when he scares the flying stars,</p>
<p>
Like Hesper rising, when the stars return;</p>
<p>
Or as, when rosy night-dissolving dawn</p>
<p>
Leads in the day, the bright sun looks abroad,</p>
<p>
And bids the barriers of the darkness yield</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span></p>
<p>
Before the beaming chariot of the morn,&mdash;</p>
<p>
So Cæsar shines, and thus shall Rome behold</p>
<p>
Her Nero; mild the lustre of his face,</p>
<p>
And neck so fair with loosely-flowing curls."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Claudius meanwhile pumped out the air-bubble of his soul,
and thereafter, as a phantasma, ceased to be visible. "He
expired while he was listening to the comedians; so that,
you perceive, I have good reason for dreading these people."
His last words were&mdash;"<span lang='it_IT'><i>Vae me, puto concavi me</i></span>."
</p>

<p>
Claudius is dead, then. It is announced to Jupiter, that
a tall personage, rather gray, has arrived; that he threatens
nobody knows what, shakes his head perpetually, and
limps with his right leg; that the language he speaks is unintelligible,
being neither that of the Greeks nor that of the
Romans, nor the tongue of any known race. Jupiter now
orders Hercules, since he has vagabondized through all the
nations of the world, and is likely to know, to see what kind
of mortal this may be. When Hercules, who had seen too many
monsters to be easily frightened, set eyes on this portentous
face, and strange gait, and heard a voice, not like the voice
of any terrestial creature, but like some sea-monster's&mdash;hoarse,
bellowing, confused, he was at first somewhat discomposed,
and thought that a thirteenth labour had arrived for him.
On closer examination, however, he thought the portent had
some resemblance to a man. He therefore asked, in Homer's
Greek&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
"Who art thou, of what race, and where thy city?"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Claudius was mightily rejoiced to meet with philologers in
heaven, and hoped he might find occasion of referring to his
own histories. [He had written twenty books of Tyrrhenian,
and eight of Carthaginian history, in Greek.] He immediately
answers from Homer also, sillily quoting the line&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>
"From Troy the wind has brought me to the Cicons."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Fever, who alone of all the Roman gods has accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
Claudius to heaven, gives him the lie, and affirms him to be
a Gaul. "And therefore, since as Gaul he could not omit it,
he took Rome." [While I write down this sentence of the
old Roman's here in Rome, and hear at the same moment
Gallic trumpets blowing, its correctness becomes very plain
to me.] Claudius immediately gives orders to cut off Fever's
head. He prevails on Hercules to bring him into the assembly
of the gods. But the god Janus proposes, that from this time
forward none of those who "eat the fruits of the field" shall
be deified; and Augustus reads his opinion from a written paper,
recommending that Claudius should be made to quit Olympus
within three days. The gods assent, and Mercury hereupon
drags off the Emperor to the infernal regions. On the Via Sacra
they fall in with the funeral procession of Claudius, which is thus
described: "It was a magnificent funeral, and such expense
had been lavished on it, that you could very well see a god
was being buried. There were flute-players, horn-blowers, and
such crowds of players on brazen instruments, and such a din,
that even Claudius could hear it. Everybody was merry and
pleased; the Populus Romanus was walking about as if it
were a free people. Agatho only, and a few pleaders, wept,
and that evidently with all their heart. The jurisconsults
were emerging from their obscure retreats&mdash;pale, emaciated,
gasping for breath, like persons newly recalled to life. One
of these noticing how the pleaders laid their heads together
and bewailed their misfortunes, came up to them and said:
'I told you your Saturnalia would not last always!'" When
Claudius saw his own funeral, he perceived that he was
dead; for, with great sound and fury, they were singing the
anapæstic nænia:&mdash;

<p>
When Claudius arrives in the nether regions, a choir of
singers hasten towards him, crying: "He is found!&mdash;joy!
joy!" [This was the cry of the Egyptians when they found
the ox Apis.] He is now surrounded by those whom he had
caused to be put to death, Polybius and his other freedmen
appearing among the rest. Æacus, as judge, examines into
the actions of his life, and finds that he has murdered thirty
senators, three hundred and fifteen knights, and citizens as
the sands of the sea. He thereupon pronounces sentence on
Claudius, and dooms him to cast dice eternally from a box
with holes in it. Suddenly Caligula appears, and claims him
as his slave. He produces witnesses, who prove that he had
frequently beat, boxed, and horsewhipped his uncle Claudius;
and as nobody seems able to dispute this, Claudius is handed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
over to Caligula. Caligula presents him to his freedman
Menander, whom he is now to help in drawing out law-papers.
</p>

<p>
Such is a sketch of this remarkable "Apokolokyntosis of
Claudius." Seneca, who had basely flattered the Emperor
while alive, was also mean enough to drag him through the
mire after he was dead. A noble soul does not take revenge
on the corpse of its foe, even though that foe may have been
but the parody of a man, and as detestable as he was ridiculous.
The insults of the coward alone are here in place.
The Apokolokyntosis faithfully reflects the degenerate baseness
of Imperial Rome.

<p>
Pasquino Seneca now transforms himself in a twinkling
into the dignified moralist; he writes his treatise "Concerning
Clemency, to the Emperor Nero"&mdash;a pleasantly contradictory
title, Nero and clemency. It is well enough known, however,
that the young Emperor, like all his predecessors, governed
without cruelty during the first years of his reign. This work
of Seneca's is of high merit, wise, and full of noble sentiment.
</p>

<p>
Nero loaded his teacher with riches; and the author of the
panegyric on poverty possessed a princely fortune, gardens,
lands, palaces, villas outside the Porta Nomentana, in Baiæ,
on the Alban Mount, upwards of six millions in value. He
lent money at usurious rates of interest in Italy and in the
provinces, greedily scraped and hoarded, fawned like a hound
upon Agrippina and her son&mdash;till times changed with him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In four years Nero had thrown off every restraint. The
murder of his mother had met with no resistance from the
timid Seneca. The high-minded Tacitus makes reproachful
allusion to him. At length Nero began to find the philosopher
inconvenient. He had already put his prefect Burrhus
to death, and Seneca had hastened to put all his wealth at
the disposal of the furious monarch; he now lived in complete
retirement. But his enemies accused him of being privy to
the conspiracy of Calpurnius Piso; and his nephew, the well-known
poet Lucan, was, not without ground, affirmed to be
similarly implicated. The conduct of Lucan in the matter
was incredibly base. He made a pusillanimous confession;
condescended to the most unmanly entreaties; and, sheltering
himself behind the illustrious example set by Nero in his
matricide, he denounced his innocent mother as a participant
in the conspiracy. This abominable proceeding did not save
him; he was condemned to voluntary death, went home,
wrote to his father Annæus Mela Seneca about some emendations
of his poems, dined luxuriously, and with the greatest
equanimity opened his veins. So self-contradictory are these
Roman characters.
</p>

<p>
Seneca is noble, great, and dignified in his end; he dies
with an almost Socratic cheerfulness, with a tranquillity
worthy of Cato. He chose bleeding as the means of his death,
and consented that his heroic wife Paulina should die in the
same way. The two were at that time in a country-house
four miles from Rome. Nero kept restlessly despatching
tribunes to the villa to see how matters were going on.
Word was brought him in haste that Paulina, too, had had
her veins opened. Nero instantly sent off an order to prevent
her death. The slaves bind the lady's wounds, staunch the
bleeding, and Paulina is rescued against her will. She lived
some years longer. Meanwhile, the blood flowed from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
aged Seneca but sparingly, and with an agonizing slowness.
He asked Statius Annæus for poison, and took it, but without
success; he then had himself put in a warm bath. He
sprinkled the surrounding slaves with water, saying; "I
make this libation to Zeus the Liberator." As he still could
not die here, he was carried into a vapour bath, and there was
suffocated. He was in his sixty-eighth year.
</p>

<p>
Reader, let us not be too hard on this philosopher, who,
after all, was a man of his degenerate time, and whose nature
is a combination of splendid talent, love of truth, and love of
wisdom, with the most despicable weaknesses. His writings
exercised great influence throughout the whole of the Middle
Ages, and have purified many a soul from vicious passion,
and guided it in nobler paths. Seneca, let us part friends.

<p>

<p>
Every valley or pieve of Cape Corso has its marina, its
little port, and anything more lonely and sequestered than
these hamlets on the quiet shore, it would be difficult to find.
It was sultry noon when I reached the strand of Luri, the
hour when Pan is wont to sleep. The people in the house
where I was to wait for the little coasting-vessel, which was to
convey me to Bastia, sat all as if in slumber. A lovely girl,
seated at the open window, was sewing as if in dream upon a
fazoletto, with a mysterious faint smile on her face, and absorbed,
plainly, in all sorts of secret, pretty thoughts of her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
own. She was embroidering something on the handkerchief;
and this something, I could see, was a little poem which her
happy heart was making on her near marriage. The blue
sea laughed through the window behind her back; it knew
the story, for the fisher-maiden had made it full confession.
The girl had on a sea-green dress, a flowered vest, and the
mandile neatly wound about her hair; the mandile was snow-white,
checked with triple rows of fine red stripes. To me,
too, did Maria Benvenuta make confession of her open mystery,
with copious prattle about winds and waves, and the
beautiful music and dancing there would be at the wedding,
up in the vale of Luri. For after some months will come
the marriage festival, and as fine a one it will be as ever
was held in Corsica.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the day on which Benvenuta is to leave
her mother's house, a splendid <span lang='it_IT'><i>trovata</i></span> will stand at the entrance
of her village, a green triumphal arch with many-coloured
ribbons. The friends, the neighbours, the kinsfolk,
will assemble on the Piazzetta to form the <span lang='it_IT'><i>corteo</i></span>&mdash;the
bridal procession. Then a youth will go up to the gaily-dressed
bride, and complain that she is leaving the place
where she was so well cared for in her childhood, and where
she never wanted for corals, nor flowers, nor friends. But
since now she is resolved to go, he, with all his heart, in the
name of her friends, wishes her happiness and prosperity,
and bids her farewell. Then Maria Benvenuta bursts into
tears, and she gives the youth a present, as a keepsake for
the commune. A horse, finely decorated, is brought before
the house, the bride mounts it, young men fully armed ride
beside her, their hats wreathed with flowers and ribbons, and
so the <span lang='it_IT'><i>corteo</i></span> moves onwards through the triumphal arch. One
youth bears the <span lang='it_IT'><i>freno</i></span>&mdash;the symbol of fruitfulness, a distaff encircled
at its top with spindles, and decked with ribbons. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
handkerchief waves from it as flag. This freno in his hand,
the <span lang='it_IT'><i>freniere</i></span> rides proudly at the head of the procession.
</p>

<p>
The <span lang='fr_FR'><i>cortège</i></span> approaches Campo, where the bridegroom lives,
and into his house the bride is now to be conducted. At the
entrance of Campo stands another magnificent trovata. A
youth steps forward, holding high in his hand an olive-twig
streaming with ribbons. This, with wise old-fashioned sayings,
he puts into the hand of the bride. Here two of the
young men of the bride's <span lang='it_IT'><i>corteo</i></span> gallop off in furious haste towards
the bridegroom's house; they are riding for the <span lang='it_IT'><i>vanto</i></span>,
that is, the honour of being the first to bring the bride the key
of the bridegroom's house. A flower is the symbol of the key.
The fastest rider has won it, and exultingly holding it in his
hand, he gallops back to the bride, to present to her the
symbol. The procession is now moving towards the house.
Women and girls crowd the balconies, and strew upon the
bride, flowers, rice, grains of wheat, and throw the fruits that
are in season among the procession with merry shoutings, and
wishes of joy. This is called <span lang='it_IT'><i>Le Grazie</i></span>. Ceaseless is the din
of muskets, mandolines, and the cornamusa, or bagpipe. Such
jubilation as there is in Campo, such shooting, and huzzaing,
and twanging, and fiddling! Such a joyous stir as there is in
the air of spring-swallows, lark-songs, flying flowers, wheat-grains,
ribbons&mdash;and all about this little Maria Benvenuta,
who sits here at the window, and embroiders the whole story
on the fazoletto.
</p>

<p>
But now the old father-in-law issues from the house, and
thus gravely addresses the Corteo of strangers:&mdash;"Who are
you, men thus armed?&mdash;friends or foes? Are you conductors
of this <span lang='it_IT'><i>donna gentile</i></span>, or have you carried her off, although to
appearance you are noble and valiant men?" The bridesman
answers, "We are your friends and guests, and we escort this
fair and worthy maiden, the pledge of our new friendship.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
We plucked the fairest flower of the strand of Luri, to bring
it as a gift to Campo."
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, then, my friends and guests, enter my house,
and refresh you at the feast;" thus replies again the bridegroom's
father, lifts the maiden from her horse, embraces her,
and leads her into the house. There the happy bridegroom
folds her in his arms, and this is done to quite a reckless
amount of merriment on the sixteen-stringed cithern, and the
cornamusa.
</p>

<p>
Now we go into the church, where the tapers are already
lit, and the myrtles profusely strewn. And when the pair
have been joined, and again enter the bridegroom's house,
they see, standing in the guest-chamber, two stools; on these
the happy couple seat themselves, and now comes a woman,
roguishly smiling, with a little child in swaddling clothes in
her arms. She lays the child in the arm of the bride. The
little Maria Benvenuta does not blush by any means, but
takes the baby and kisses and fondles it right heartily. Then
she puts on his head a little Phrygian cap, richly decked with
particoloured ribbons. When this part of the ceremony has
been gone through, the kinsfolk embrace the pair, and each
wishes the good old wish:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
<span lang='it_IT'>"Dio vi dia buona fortuna,</span></p>
<p>
<span lang='it_IT'>Tre di maschi e femmin' una:"</span></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
&mdash;that is, God give you good luck, three sons and a daughter.
The bride now distributes little gifts to her husband's relatives;
the nearest relation receives a small coin. Then follow
the feast and the balls, at which they will dance the <span lang='it_IT'><i>cerca</i></span>,
and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>marsiliana</i></span>, and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>tarantella</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
Whether they will observe the rest of the old usages, as
they are given in the chronicle, I do not know. But in
former times it was the custom that a young relation of the
bride should precede her into the nuptial chamber. Here he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>[240]</a></span>
jumped and rolled several times over the bridal-bed, then, the
bride sitting down on it, he untied the ribbons on her shoes,
as respectfully as we see upon the old sculptures Anchises
unloosing the sandals of Venus, as she sits upon her couch.
The bride now moved her little feet prettily till the shoes
slipped to the ground; and to the youth who had untied
them, she gave a present of money. To make a long story
short, they will have a merry time of it at Benvenuta's
wedding, and when long years have gone by, they will still
remember it in the Valley of Campo.
</p>

<p>
All this we gossiped over very gravely in the boatman's
little house at Luri; and I know the cradle-song too with
which Maria Benvenuta will hush her little son to sleep&mdash;

CORSICAN SUPERSTITIONS.
</h3>

<p>
In the meantime, voices from the shore had announced the
arrival of the boatmen; I therefore took my leave of the
pretty Benvenuta, wished her all sorts of pleasant things, and
stepped into the boat. We kept always as close as possible in
shore. At Porticcioli, a little town with a Dogana, we ran
in to have the names of our four passengers registered. A
few sailing vessels were anchored here. The ripe figs on the
trees, and the beautiful grapes in the gardens, tempted us; we
had half a vineyard of the finest muscatel grapes, with the
most delicious figs, brought us for a few pence.
</p>

<p>
Continuing our voyage in the evening, the beauty of the
moonlit sea, and the singular forms of the rocky coast, served
to beguile the way pleasantly. I saw a great many towers on
the rocks, here and there a ruin, a church, or cloister. As we
sailed past the old Church of St. Catherine of Sicco, which
stands high and stately on the shore, the weather seemed going
"to desolate itself," as they say in Italian, and threatened
a storm. The old steersman, as we came opposite St. Catherine,
doffed his baretto, and prayed aloud: "Holy Mother
of God, Maria, we are sailing to Bastia; grant that we get
safely into port!" The boatmen all took off their baretti,
and devoutly made the sign of the cross. The moonlight
breaking on the water from heavy black clouds; the fear of
a storm; the grim, spectrally-lighted shore; and finally, St.
Catherine,&mdash;suddenly brought over our entire company one of
those moods which seek relief in ghost-stories. The boatmen
began to tell them, in all varieties of the horrible and incredible.
One of the passengers, meanwhile, anxious that at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
least not all Corsicans should seem, in the strangers' eyes, to
be superstitious, kept incessantly shrugging his shoulders, indignant,
as a person of enlightenment, that I should hear such
nonsense; while another constantly supported his own and the
boatmen's opinion, by the asseveration: "I have never seen
witches with my own eyes, but that there is such a thing as
the black art is undoubted." I, for my part, affirmed that I
confidently believed in witches and sorceresses, and that I had
had the honour of knowing some very fine specimens. The
partisan of the black art, an inhabitant of Luri, had, I may
mention, allowed me an interesting glimpse into his mysterious
studies, when, in the course of a conversation about London,
he very naïvely threw out the question, whether that
great city was French or not.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans call the witch <span lang='it_IT'><i>strega</i></span>. Her <span lang='fr_FR'><i>penchant</i></span> is to
suck, as vampire, the blood of children. One of the boatmen
described to me how she looked, when he surprised her once
in his father's house; she is black as pitch on the breast, and
can transform herself from a cat into a beautiful girl, and
from a beautiful girl into a cat. These sorceresses torment
the children, make frightful faces at them, and all sorts of
<span lang='it_IT'><i>fattura</i></span>. They can bewitch muskets, too, and make them
miss fire. In this case, you must make a cross over the trigger,
and, in general, you may be sure the cross is the best
protection against sorcery. It is a very safe thing, too, to
carry relics and amulets. Some of these will turn off a bullet,
and are good against the bite of the venomous spider&mdash;the
<span lang='it_IT'><i>malmignatto</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
Among these amulets they had formerly in Corsica a "travelling-stone,"
such as is frequently mentioned in the Scandinavian
legends. It was found at the Tower of Seneca only&mdash;was
four-cornered, and contained iron. Whoever tied such a
stone over his knee made a safe and easy journey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'>[244]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many of the pagan usages of ancient Corsica have been
lost, many still exist, particularly in the highland pasture-country
of Niolo. Among these, the practice of soothsaying by
bones is remarkable. The fortune-teller takes the shoulder-blade
(<span lang='it_IT'><i>scapula</i></span>) of a goat or sheep, gives its surface a polish
as of a mirror, and reads from it the history of the person concerned.
But it must be the left shoulder-blade, for, according
to the old proverb&mdash;<span lang='it_IT'><i>la destra spalla sfalla</i></span>&mdash;the right one
deceives. Many famous Corsicans are said to have had their
fortunes predicted by soothsayers. It is told that, as Sampiero
sat with his friends at table, the evening before his death, an
owl was heard to scream upon the house-top, where it sat
hooting the whole night; and that, when a soothsayer hereupon
read the scapula, to the horror of all, he found Sampiero's
death written in it.
</p>

<p>
Napoleon's fortunes, too, were foretold from a <span lang='it_IT'><i>spalla</i></span>. An
old herdsman of Ghidazzo, renowned for reading shoulder-blades,
inspected the scapula one day, when Napoleon was
still a child, and saw thereon, plainly represented, a tree rising
with many branches high into the heavens, but having few
and feeble roots. From this the herdsman saw that a Corsican
would become ruler of the world, but only for a short time.
The story of this prediction is very common in Corsica;
it has a remarkable affinity with the dream of Mandane, in
which she saw the tree interpreted to mean her son Cyrus.
</p>

<p>
Many superstitious beliefs of the Corsicans, with a great
deal of poetic fancy in them, relate to death&mdash;the true genius
of the Corsican popular poetry; since on this island of the
Vendetta, death has so peculiarly his mythic abode; Corsica
might be called the Island of Death, as other islands were
called of Apollo, of Venus, or of Jupiter. When any one is
about to die, a pale light upon the house-top frequently announces
what is to happen. The owl screeches the whole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
night, the dog howls, and often a little drum is heard, which
a ghost beats. If any one's death is near, sometimes the dead
people come at night to his house, and make it known. They
are dressed exactly like the Brothers of Death, in the long
white mantles, with the pointed hoods in which are the spectral
eye-holes; and they imitate all the gestures of the Brothers
of Death, who place themselves round the bier, lift it, bear it,
and go before it. This is their dismal pastime all night till
the cock crows. When the cock crows, they slip away, some
to the churchyard, some into their graves in the church.
</p>

<p>
The dead people are fond of each other's company; you
will see them coming out of the graves if you go to the
churchyard at night; then make quickly the sign of the cross
over the trigger of your gun, that the ghost-shot may go off
well. For a full shot has power over the spectres; and when
you shoot among them, they disperse, and not till ten years
after such a shot can they meet again.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the dead come to the bedside of those who have
survived, and say, "Now lament for me no more, and cease
weeping, for I have the certainty that I shall yet be among
the blessed."
</p>

<p>
In the silent night-hours, when you sit upon your bed, and
your sad heart will not let you sleep, often the dead call you
by name: "O Marì!&mdash;O Josè!" For your life do not answer,
though they cry ever so mournfully, and your heart be like to
break. Answer not! if you answer, you must die.
</p>

<p>
"Andate! andate! the storm is coming! Look at the tromba
there, as it drives past Elba!" And vast and dark swept the
mighty storm-spectre over the sea, a sight of terrific beauty; the
moon was hid, and sea and shore lay wan in the glare of lightning.&mdash;God
be praised! we are at the Tower of Bastia. The
holy Mother of God <i>had</i> helped us, and as we stepped on land,
the storm began in furious earnest. We, however, were in port.

CHAPTER I.
</span>
<br />
<br />
VESCOVATO AND THE CORSICAN HISTORIANS.
</h3>

<p>
Some miles to the southwards of Bastia, on the heights of
the east coast, lies Vescovato, a spot celebrated in Corsican
history. Leaving the coast-road at the tower of Buttafuoco,
you turn upwards into the hills, the way leading through
magnificent forests of chestnuts, which cover the heights on
every side. The general name for this beautiful little district
is Casinca; and the region round Vescovato is honoured with
the special appellation of Castagniccia, or the land of chestnuts.
</p>

<p>
I was curious to see this Corsican paese, in which Count
Matteo Buttafuoco once offered Rousseau an asylum; I expected
to find a village such as I had already seen frequently
enough among the mountains. I was astonished, therefore,
when I saw Vescovato before me, lost in the green hills
among magnificent groves of chestnuts, oranges, vines, fruit-trees
of every kind, a mountain brook gushing down through
it, the houses of primitive Corsican cast, yet here and there
not without indications of architectural taste. I now could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
not but own to myself that of all the retreats that a misanthropic
philosopher might select, the worst was by no means
Vescovato. It is a mountain hermitage, in the greenest,
shadiest solitude, with the loveliest walks, where you can
dream undisturbed, now among the rocks by the wild stream,
now under a blossom-laden bush of erica beside an ivy-hung
cloister, or you are on the brow of a hill from which the eye
looks down upon the plain of the Golo, rich and beautiful as
a nook of paradise, and upon the sea.
</p>

<p>
A bishop built the place; and the bishops of the old town
of Mariana, which lay below in the plain, latterly lived here.
</p>

<p>
Historic names and associations cluster thickly round Vescovato;
especially is it honoured by its connexion with three
Corsican historians of the sixteenth century&mdash;Ceccaldi, Monteggiani,
and Filippini.  Their memory is still as fresh as
their houses are well preserved. The Curato of the place
conducted me to Filippini's house, a mean peasant's cottage.
I could not repress a smile when I was shown a stone taken
from the wall, on which the most celebrated of the Corsican
historians had in the fulness of his heart engraved the
following inscription:&mdash;<span lang='la'><i>Has Ædes ad suum et amicorum
usum in commodiorem Formam redegit anno</i></span> <span class="smcap">MDLXXV.</span>, <span lang='la'><i>cal. Decemb.
A. Petrus Philippinus Archid. Marian.</i></span> In sooth, the
pretensions of these worthy men were extremely humble.
Another stone exhibits Filippini's coat of arms&mdash;his house,
with a horse tied to a tree. It was the custom of the archdeacon
to write his history in his vineyard, which they still
show in Vescovato. After riding up from Mariana, he fastened
his horse under a pine, and sat down to meditate or to write,
protected by the high walls of his garden&mdash;for his life was
in constant danger from the balls of his enemies. He thus
wrote the history of the Corsicans under impressions highly
exciting and dramatic.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'>[248]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Filippini's book is the leading work on Corsican history,
and is of a thoroughly national character. The Corsicans may
well be proud of it. It is an organic growth from the popular
mind of the country; songs, traditions, chronicles, and,
latterly, professed and conscious historical writing, go to constitute
the work as it now lies before us. The first who
wrought upon it was Giovanni della Grossa, lieutenant and
secretary of the brave Vincentello d'Istria. He collected the
old legends and traditions, and proceeded as Paul Diaconus
did in his history. He brought down the history of Corsica
to the year 1464. His scholar, Monteggiani, continued it to
the year 1525,&mdash;but this part of the history is meagre; then
came Ceccaldi, who continued it to the year 1559; and Filippini,
who brought it as far as 1594. Of the thirteen books
composing the whole, he has, therefore, written only the last
four; but he edited and gave form to the entire work, so that
it now bears his name. The <span lang='la'><i>editio princeps</i></span> appeared in
Tournon in France, in 1594, in Italian, under the following
title:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The History of Corsica, in which all things are recorded
that have happened from the time that it began to be inhabited
up till the year 1594. With a general description of the entire
Island; divided into thirteen books, and commenced by Giovanni
della Grossa, who wrote the first nine thereof, which
were continued by Pier Antonio Monteggiani, and afterwards
by Marc' Antonio Ceccaldi, and were collected and enlarged
by the Very Reverend Antonpietro Filippini, Archidiaconus of
Mariana, the last four being composed by himself. Diligently
revised and given to the light by the same Archidiaconus. In
Tournon. In the printing-house of Claudio Michael, Printer
to the University, 1594."
</p>

<p>
Although an opponent of Sampiero, and though, from
timidity, or from deliberate intent to falsify, frequently guilty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
of suppressing or perverting facts, he, nevertheless, told the
Genoese so many bitter truths in his book, that the Republic
did everything in its power to prevent its circulation.
It had become extremely scarce when Pozzo di Borgo did his
country the signal service of having it edited anew. The
learned Corsican, Gregori, was the new editor, and he furnished
the work with an excellent introduction; it appeared, as
edited by Gregori, at Pisa, in the year 1827, in five volumes.
The Corsicans are certainly worthy to have the documentary
monuments of their history well attended to. Their modern
historians blame Filippini severely for incorporating in his
history all the traditions and fables of Grossa. For my part,
I have nothing but praise to give him for this; his history
must not be judged according to strict scientific rules; it
possesses, as we have it, the high value of bearing the undisguised
impress of the popular mind. I have equally little sympathy
with the fault-finders in their depreciation of Filippini's
talent. He is somewhat prolix, but his vein is rich; and a
sound philosophic morality, based on accurate observation of life,
pervades his writings. The man is to be held in honour; he
has done his people justice, though no adherent of the popular
cause, but a partisan of Genoa. Without Filippini, a great
part of Corsican history would by this time have been buried
in obscurity. He dedicated his work to Alfonso d'Ornano,
Sampiero's son, in token of his satisfaction at the young
hero's reconciling himself to Genoa, and even visiting that
city.
</p>

<p>
"When I undertook to write the History," he says, "I trusted
more to the gifts which I enjoy from nature, than to that acquired
skill and polish which is expected in those who make
similar attempts. I thought to myself that I should stand excused
in the eyes of those who should read me, if they considered
how great the want of all provision for such an undertaking is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
in this island (in which I must live, since it has pleased God
to cast my lot here); so that scientific pursuits, of whatever
kind, are totally impossible, not to speak of writing a pure and
quite faultless style." There are other passages in Filippini,
in which he complains with equal bitterness of the ignorance
of the Corsicans, and their total want of cultivation in
any shape. He does not even except the clergy, "among
whom," says he, "there are hardly a dozen who have learned
grammar; while among the Franciscans, although they have
five-and-twenty convents, there are scarcely so many as eight
lettered men; and thus the whole nation grows up in ignorance."
</p>

<p>
He never conceals the faults of his countrymen. "Besides
their ignorance," he remarks, "one can find no words to express
the laziness of the islanders where the tilling of the
ground is concerned. Even the fairest plain in the world&mdash;the
plain that extends from Aleria to Mariana&mdash;lies desolate;
and they will not so much as drive away the fowls. But
when it chances that they have become masters of a single
carlino, they imagine that it is impossible now that they can
ever want, and so sink into complete idleness."&mdash;This is a
strikingly apt characterization of the Corsicans of the present
day. "Why does no one prop the numberless wild oleasters?"
asks Filippini; "why not the chestnuts? But they do nothing,
and therefore are they all poor. Poverty leads to
crime; and daily we hear of robberies. They also swear false
oaths. Their feuds and their hatred, their little love and
their little faithfulness, are quite endless; hence that proverb
is true which we are wont to hear: 'The Corsican never
forgives.' And hence arises all that calumniating, and all
that backbiting, that we see perpetually. The people of
Corsica (as Braccellio has written) are, beyond other nations,
rebellious, and given to change; many are addicted to a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251'>[251]</a></span>
superstition which they call Magonie, and thereto they
use the men as women. There prevails here also a kind of
soothsaying, which they practise with the shoulder-bones of
dead animals."
</p>

<p>
Such is the dark side of the picture which the Corsican
historian draws of his countrymen; and he here spares them
so little, that, in fact, he merely reproduces what Seneca is
said to have written of them in the lines&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
<span lang='la'>"Prima est ulcisi lex, altera vivere raptu,</span></p>
<p>
<span lang='la'>Tertia mentiri, quarta negare Deos."</span></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
On the other hand, in the dedication to Alfonso, he defends
most zealously the virtues of his people against Tomaso
Porcacchi Aretino da Castiglione, who had attacked them in
his "Description of the most famous Islands of the World."
"This man," says Filippini, "speaks of the Corsicans as
assassins, which makes me wonder at him with no small
astonishment, for there will be found, I may well venture to
say, no people in the world among whom strangers are more
lovingly handled, and among whom they can travel with
more safety; for throughout all Corsica they meet with the
utmost hospitality and courteousness, without having ever to
expend the smallest coin for their maintenance." This is
true; a stranger here corroborates the Corsican historian,
after a lapse of three hundred years.
</p>

<p>
As in Vescovato we are standing on the sacred ground of
Corsican historiography, I may mention a few more of the
Corsican historians. An insular people, with a past so rich
in striking events, heroic struggles, and great men, and characterized
by a patriotism so unparalleled, might also be expected
to be rich in writers of the class referred to; and
certainly their numbers, as compared with the small population,
are astonishing. I give only the more prominent
names.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252'>[252]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Next to Filippini, the most note-worthy of the Corsican
historiographers is Petrus Cyrnæus, Archdeacon of Aleria,
the other ancient Roman colony. He lived in the fifteenth
century, and wrote, besides his <span lang='la'><i>Commentarium de Bello Ferrariensi</i></span>,
a History of Corsica extending down to the year
1482, in Latin, with the title, <span lang='la'><i>Petri Cyrnæi de rebus Corsicis
libri quatuor</i></span>. His Latin is as classical as that of the best
authors of his time; breadth and vigour characterize his style,
which has a resemblance to that of Sallust or Tacitus; but
his treatment of his materials is thoroughly unartistic. He
dwells longest on the siege of Bonifazio by Alfonso of Arragon,
and on the incidents of his own life. Filippini did not know,
and therefore could not use the work of Cyrnæus; it existed
only in manuscript till brought to light from the library of
Louis XV., and incorporated in Muratori's large work in the
year 1738. The excellent edition (Paris, 1834) which we
now possess we owe to the munificence of Pozzo di Borgo,
and the literary ability of Gregori, who has added an Italian
translation of the Latin text.
</p>

<p>
This author's estimate of the Corsicans is still more characteristic
and intelligent than that of Filippini. Let us hear
what he has to say, that we may see whether the present
Corsicans have retained much or little of the nature of their
forefathers who lived in those early times:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They are eager to avenge an injury, and it is reckoned
disgraceful not to take vengeance. When they cannot reach
him who has done the murder, then they punish one of his
relations. On this account, as soon as a murder has taken
place, all the relatives of the murderer instantly arm themselves
in their own defence. Only children and women are
spared." He describes the arms of the Corsicans of his time
as follows: "They wear pointed helms, called cerbelleras;
others also round ones; further daggers, spears four ells long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
of which each man has two. On the left side rests the sword,
on the right the dagger.
</p>

<p>
"In their own country, they are at discord; out of it,
they hold fast to each other. Their souls are ready for
death (<span lang='la'><i>animi ad mortem parati</i></span>). They are universally
poor, and despise trade. They are greedy of renown;
gold and silver they scarcely use at all. Drunkenness they
think a great disgrace. They seldom learn to read and
write; few of them hear the orators or the poets; but in disputation
they exercise themselves so continually, that when a
cause has to be decided, you would think them all very admirable
pleaders. Among the Corsicans, I never saw a head
that was bald. The Corsicans are of all men the most hospitable.
Their own wives cook their victuals for the highest
men in the land. They are by nature inclined to silence&mdash;made
rather for acting than for speaking. They are also
the most religious of mortals.
</p>

<p>
"It is the custom to separate the men from the women,
more especially at table. The wives and daughters fetch the
water from the well; for the Corsicans have almost no menials.
The Corsican women are industrious: you may see them, as
they go to the fountain, bearing the pitcher on their head,
leading the horse, if they have one, by a halter over their
arm, and at the same time turning the spindle. They are
also very chaste, and are not long sleepers.
</p>

<p>
"The Corsicans inter their dead expensively; for they
bury them not without exequies, without laments, without
panegyric, without dirges, without prayer. For their funeral
solemnities are very similar to those of the Romans. One of
the neighbours raises the cry, and calls to the nearest village:
'Ho there! cry to the other village, for such a one is just
dead.' Then they assemble according to their villages,
their towns, and their communities, walking one by one in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
long line&mdash;first the men and then the women. When these
arrive, all raise a great wailing, and the wife and brothers
tear the clothes upon their breast. The women, disfigured
with weeping, smite themselves on the bosom, lacerate the
face, and tear out the hair.&mdash;All Corsicans are free."
</p>

<p>
The reader will have found that this picture of the Corsicans
resembles in many points the description Tacitus gives
us of the ancient Germans.
</p>

<p>
Corsican historiography has at no time flourished more than
during the heroic fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; it was
silent during the seventeenth, because at that period the
entire people lay in a state of death-like exhaustion; in the
eighteenth, participating in the renewed vitality of the age,
it again became active, and we have Natali's treatise <span lang='it_IT'><i>Disinganno
sulla guerra di Corsica</i></span>, and Salvini's <span lang='it_IT'><i>Giustificazione
dell' Insurrezione</i></span>&mdash;useful books, but of no great literary
merit.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Limperani wrote a History of Corsica to the end of the
seventeenth century, a work full of valuable materials, but
prosy and long-winded. Very serviceable&mdash;in fact, from the
documents it contains, indispensable&mdash;is the History of the
Corsicans, by Cambiaggi, in four quarto volumes. Cambiaggi
dedicated his work to Frederick the Great, the admirer of
Pasquale Paoli and Corsican heroism.
</p>

<p>
Now that the Corsican people have lost their freedom, the
learned patriots of Corsica&mdash;and Filippini would no longer
have to complain of the dearth of literary cultivation among his
countrymen&mdash;have devoted themselves with praiseworthy zeal
to the history of their country. These men are generally advocates.
We have, for example, Pompei's book, <span lang='fr_FR'><i>L'Etat actuel
de la Corse</i></span>; Gregori edited Filippini and Peter Cyrnæus,
and made a collection of the Corsican Statutes&mdash;a highly
meritorious work. These laws originated in the old traditionary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
jurisprudence of the Corsicans, which the democracy
of Sampiero adopted, giving it a more definite and comprehensive
form. They underwent further additions and improvements
during the supremacy of the Genoese, who finally,
in the sixteenth century, collected them into a code. They
had become extremely scarce. The new edition is a splendid
monument of Corsican history, and the codex itself does the
Genoese much credit. Renucci, another talented Corsican,
has written a <span lang='it_IT'><i>Storia di Corsica</i></span>, in two volumes, published at
Bastia in 1833, which gives an abridgment of the earlier history,
and a detailed account of events during the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, up to 1830. The work is rich in
material, but as a historical composition feeble. Arrighi wrote
biographies of Sampiero and Pasquale Paoli. Jacobi's work
in two volumes is the History of Corsica in most general use.
It extends down to the end of the war of independence under
Paoli, and is to be completed in a third volume. Jacobi's
merit consists in having written a systematically developed
history of the Corsicans, using all the available sources; his
book is indispensable, but defective in critical acumen, and
far from sufficiently objective. The latest book on Corsican
history, is an excellent little compendium by Camillo Friess,
keeper of the Archives in Ajaccio, who told me he proposed
writing at greater length on the same subject. He has my best
wishes for the success of such an undertaking, for he is a man of
original and vigorous intellect. It is to be hoped he will not,
like Jacobi, write his work in French, but, as he is bound in
duty to his people, in Italian.

<br />

ROUSSEAU AND THE CORSICANS.
</h3>

<p>
I did not neglect to visit the house of Count Matteo Buttafuoco,
which was at one time to have been the domicile of
Rousseau. It is a structure of considerable pretensions, the
stateliest in Vescovato. Part of it is at present occupied by
Marshal Sebastiani, whose family belongs to the neighbouring
village of Porta.
</p>

<p>
This Count Buttafuoco is the same man against whom
Napoleon wrote an energetic pamphlet, when a fiery young
democrat in Ajaccio. The Count was an officer in the French
army when he invited Jean Jacques Rousseau to Vescovato.
The philosopher of Geneva had, in his <span lang='fr_FR'><i>Contrat Social</i></span>, written
and prophesied as follows with regard to Corsica: "There is
still one country in Europe susceptible of legislation&mdash;the island
of Corsica. The vigour and perseverance displayed by the
Corsicans, in gaining and defending their freedom, are such
as entitle them to claim the aid of some wise man to teach
them how to preserve it. I have an idea that this little island
will one day astonish Europe." When the French were sending
out their last and decisive expedition against Corsica,
Rousseau wrote: "It must be confessed that your French
are a very servile race, a people easily bought by despotism,
and shamefully cruel to the unfortunate; if they knew of a
free man at the other end of the world, I believe they would
march all the way thither, for the mere pleasure of exterminating
him."
</p>

<p>
I shall not affirm that this was a second prophecy of Rousseau's,
but the first has certainly been fulfilled, for the day
has come in which the Corsicans <i>have</i> astonished Europe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The favourable opinion of the Corsican people, thus expressed
by Rousseau, induced Paoli to invite him to Corsica in 1764,
that he might escape from the persecution of his enemies in
Switzerland. Voltaire, always enviously and derisively inclined
towards Rousseau, had spread the malicious report that
this offer of an asylum in Corsica was merely a ridiculous
trick some one was playing on him. Upon this, Paoli had
himself written the invitation. Buttafuoco had gone further;
he had called upon the philosopher&mdash;of whom the Poles also
begged a constitution&mdash;to compose a code of laws for the
Corsicans. Paoli does not seem to have opposed the scheme,
perhaps because he considered such a work, though useless for
its intended purpose, still as, in one point of view, likely to increase
the reputation of the Corsicans. The vain misanthrope
thus saw himself in the flattering position of a Pythagoras,
and joyfully wrote, in answer, that the simple idea of occupying
himself with such a task elevated and inspired his soul;
and that he should consider the remainder of his unhappy days
nobly and virtuously spent, if he could spend them to the
advantage of the brave Corsicans. He now, with all seriousness,
asked for materials. The endless petty annoyances in
which he was involved, prevented him ever producing the
work. But what would have been its value if he had? What
were the Corsicans to do with a theory, when they had already
given themselves a constitution of practical efficiency, thoroughly
popular, because formed on the material basis of their
traditions and necessities?
</p>

<p>
Circumstances prevented Rousseau's going to Corsica&mdash;pity!
He might have made trial of his theories there&mdash;for
the island seems the realized Utopia of his views of that normal
condition of society which he so lauds in his treatise on
the question&mdash;Whether or not the arts and sciences have been
beneficial to the human race? In Corsica, he would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
had what he wanted, in plenty&mdash;primitive mortals in woollen
blouses, living on goat's-milk and a few chestnuts, neither
science nor art&mdash;equality, bravery, hospitality&mdash;and revenge
to the death! I believe the warlike Corsicans would have
laughed heartily to have seen Rousseau wandering about
under the chestnuts, with his cat on his arm, or plaiting
his basket-work. But Vendetta! vendetta! bawled once or
twice, with a few shots of the fusil, would very soon have
frightened poor Jacques away again. Nevertheless Rousseau's
connexion with Corsica is memorable, and stands in intimate
relation with the most characteristic features of his history.
</p>

<p>
In the letter in which he notifies to Count Buttafuoco his
inability to accept his invitation, Rousseau writes: "I have
not lost the sincere desire of living in your country; but the
complete exhaustion of my energies, the anxieties I should
incur, and the fatigues I should undergo, with other hindrances
arising from my position, compel me, at least for the present,
to relinquish my resolution; though, notwithstanding these
difficulties, I find I cannot reconcile myself to the thought of
utterly abandoning it. I am growing old; I am growing
frail; my powers are leaving me; my wishes tempt me on,
and yet my hopes grow dim. Whatever the issue may be,
receive, and render to Signor Paoli, my liveliest, my heartfelt
thanks, for the asylum which he has done me the honour
to offer me. Brave and hospitable people! I shall never
forget it so long as I live, that your hearts, your arms, were
opened to me, at a time when there was hardly another asylum
left for me in Europe. If it should not be my good fortune
to leave my ashes in your island, I shall at least endeavour
to leave there a monument of my gratitude; and I shall do
myself honour, in the eyes of the whole world, when I call
you my hosts and protectors. What I hereby promise to you,
and what you may henceforth rely on, is this, that I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
occupy the rest of my life only with myself or with Corsica;
all other interests are completely banished from my soul."
</p>

<p>
The concluding words promise largely; but they are in
Rousseau's usual glowing and rhetorical vein. How singularly
such a style, and the entire Rousseau nature, contrast
with the austere taciturnity, the manly vigour, the wild and
impetuous energy of the Corsican! Rousseau and Corsican
seem ideas standing at an infinite distance apart&mdash;natures the
very antipodes of each other, and yet they touch each other
like corporeal and incorporeal, united in time and thought.
It is strange to hear, amid the prophetic dreams of a universal
democracy predicted by Rousseau, the wild clanging of that
Corybantian war-dance of the Corsicans under Paoli, proclaiming
the new era which their heroic struggle began. It is as
if they would deafen, with the clangour of their arms, the
old despotic gods, while the new divinity is being born upon
their island, Jupiter&mdash;Napoleon, the revolutionary god of the
iron age.

<h3><span class="b12">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />
<br />

THE MORESCA&mdash;ARMED DANCE OF THE CORSICANS.
</h3>

<p>
The Corsicans, like other brave peoples of fiery and imaginative
temperament, have a war-dance, called the Moresca. Its
origin is matter of dispute&mdash;some asserting it to be Moorish
and others Greek. The Greeks called these dances of warlike
youths, armed with sword and shield, Pyrrhic dances;
and ascribed their invention to Minerva, and Pyrrhus, the
son of Achilles. It is uncertain how they spread themselves
over the more western countries; but, ever since the
struggles of the Christians and Moors, they have been called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
Moresca; and it appears that they are everywhere practised
where the people are rich in traditions of that old
gigantic, world-historical contest between Christian and Pagan,
Europe and Asia,&mdash;as among the Albanians in Greece,
among the Servians, the Montenegrins, the Spaniards, and
other nations.
</p>

<p>
I do not know what significance is elsewhere attached to
the Moresca, as I have only once, in Genoa, witnessed this
magnificent dance; but in Corsica it has all along preserved
peculiarities attaching to the period of the Crusades, the Moresca
there always representing a conflict between Saracens
and Christians; the deliverance of Jerusalem, perhaps, or the
conquest of Granada, or the taking of the Corsican cities
Aleria and Mariana, by Hugo Count Colonna. The Moresca
has thus assumed a half religious, half profane character, and
has received from its historical relations a distinctive and
national impress.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans have at all times produced the spectacle of
this dance, particularly in times of popular excitement and
struggle, when a national armed sport of this kind was likely
of itself to inflame the beholders, while at the same time it
reminded them of the great deeds of their forefathers. I know
of no nobler pleasure for a free and manly people, than the
spectacle of the Moresca, the flower and poetry of the mood
that prompts to and exults in fight. It is the only national
drama the Corsicans have; as they were without other amusement,
they had the heroic deeds of their ancestors represented
to them in dance, on the same soil that they had steeped in
their blood. It might frequently happen that they rose from
the Moresca to rush into battle.
</p>

<p>
Vescovato, as Filippini mentions, was often the theatre of
the Moresca. The people still remember that it was danced
there in honour of Sampiero; it was also produced in Vescovato
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
in the time of Paoli. The most recent performance is that
of the year 1817.
</p>

<p>
The representation of the conquest of Mariana, by Hugo
Colonna, was that most in favour. A village was supposed
to represent the town. The stage was a piece of open ground,
the green hills served as amphitheatre, and on their sides lay
thousands and thousands, gathered from all parts of the island.
Let the reader picture to himself such a public as this&mdash;rude,
fierce men, all in arms, grouped under the chestnuts, with look,
voice, and gesture accompanying the clanging hero-dance.
The actors, sometimes two hundred in number, are in two
separate troops; all wear the Roman toga. Each dancer
holds in his right hand a sword, in his left a dagger; the
colour of the plume and the breastplate alone distinguish
Moors from Christians. The fiddle-bow of a single violin-player
rules the Moresca.
</p>

<p>
It begins. A Moorish astrologer issues from Mariana dressed
in the caftan, and with a long white beard; he looks to the sky
and consults the heavenly luminaries, and in dismay he predicts
misfortune. With gestures of alarm he hastens back within
the gate. And see! yonder comes a Moorish messenger, headlong
terror in look and movement, rushing towards Mariana
with the news that the Christians have already taken Aleria
and Corte, and are marching on Mariana. Just as the messenger
vanishes within the city, horns blow, and enter Hugo
Colonna with the Christian army. Exulting shouts greet
him from the hills.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;still new evolutions, till at length they dance the last
figure, called the <span lang='it_IT'><i>resa</i></span>, and the Saracen yields.
</p>

<p>
When I saw the Moresca in Genoa, it was being performed
in honour of the Sardinian constitution, on its anniversary
day, May the 9th; for the beautiful dance has in Italy a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>[263]</a></span>
revolutionary significance, and is everywhere forbidden except
where the government is liberal. The people in their picturesque
costumes, particularly the women in their long white
veils, covering the esplanade at the quay, presented a magnificent
spectacle. About thirty young men, all in a white
dress fitting tightly to the body; one party with green, the
other with red scarfs round the waist, danced the Moresca to
an accompaniment of horns and trumpets. They all had
rapiers in each hand; and as they danced the various movements,
they struck the weapons against each other. This
Moresca appeared to have no historical reference.
</p>

<p>
The Corsicans, like the Spaniards, have also preserved the
old theatrical representations of the sufferings of our Saviour;
they are now, however, seldom given. In the year 1808, a
spectacle of this kind was produced in Orezza, before ten thousand
people. Tents represented the houses of Pilate, Herod,
and Caiaphas. There were angels, and there were devils who
ascended through a trap-door. Pilate's wife was a young
fellow of twenty-three, with a coal-black beard. The commander
of the Roman soldiery wore the uniform of the French
national guards, with a colonel's epaulettes of gold and silver;
the officer second in command wore an infantry uniform, and
both had the cross of the Legion of Honour on their breast.
A priest, the curato of Carcheto, played the part of Judas. As
the piece was commencing, a disturbance arose from some
unknown cause among the spectators, who bombarded each
other with pieces of rock, with which they supplied themselves
from the natural amphitheatre.

<p>
There is still a third very remarkable house in Vescovato&mdash;the
house of the Ceccaldi family, from which two illustrious
Corsicans have sprung; the historian already mentioned, and
the brave General Andrew Colonna Ceccaldi, in his day one
of the leading patriots of Corsica, and Triumvir along with
Giafferi and Hyacinth Paoli.
</p>

<p>
But the house has other associations of still greater interest.
It is the house of General Franceschetti, or rather of his
wife Catharina Ceccaldi, and it was here that the unfortunate
King Joachim Murat was hospitably received when he landed
in Corsica on his flight from Provence; and here that he
formed the plan for re-conquering his beautiful realm of
Naples, by a chivalrous <span lang='fr_FR'><i>coup de main</i></span>.
</p>

<p>
Once more, therefore, the history of a bold caballero passes
in review before us on this strange enchanted island, where
kings' crowns hang upon the trees, like golden apples in the
Gardens of the Hesperides.
</p>

<p>
Murat's end is more touching than that of almost any other
of those men who have careered for a while with meteoric
splendour through the world, and then had a sudden and
lamentable fall.
</p>

<p>
After his last rash and ill-conducted war in Italy, Murat
had sought refuge in France. In peril of his life, wandering
about in the vineyards and woods, he concealed himself for
some time in the vicinity of Toulon; to an old grenadier he
owed his rescue from death by hunger. The same Marquis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>[265]</a></span>
of Rivière who had so generously protected Murat after the
conspiracy of George Cadoudal and Pichegru, sent out soldiers
after the fugitive, with orders to take him, alive or dead. In
this frightful extremity, Joachim resolved to claim hospitality
in the neighbouring island of Corsica. He hoped to find protection
among a noble people, in whose eyes the person of a
guest is sacred.
</p>

<p>
He accordingly left his lurking-place, reached the shore in
safety, and obtained a vessel which, braving a fearful storm
and imminent danger of wreck, brought him safely to Corsica.
He landed at Bastia on the 25th of August 1815, and hearing
that General Franceschetti, who had formerly served in his
guard at Naples, was at that time in Vescovato, he immediately
proceeded thither. He knocked at the door of the
house of the Maire Colonna Ceccaldi, father-in-law of the
general, and asked to see the latter. In the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>Mémoires</i></span> he has
written on Murat's residence in Corsica, and his attempt on
Naples, Franceschetti says:&mdash;"A man presents himself to me
muffled in a cloak, his head buried in a cap of black silk,
with a bushy beard, in pantaloons, in the gaiters and shoes of
a common soldier, haggard with privation and anxiety. What
was my amazement to detect under this coarse and common
disguise King Joachim&mdash;a prince but lately the centre of such
a brilliant court! A cry of astonishment escapes me, and I
fall at his knees."
</p>

<p>
The news that the King of Naples had landed occasioned
some excitement in Bastia, and many Corsican officers hastened
to Vescovato to offer him their services. The commandant
of Bastia, Colonel Verrière, became alarmed. He sent an
officer with a detachment of gendarmes to Vescovato, with
orders to make themselves masters of Joachim's person. But
the people of Vescovato instantly ran to arms, and prepared
to defend the sacred laws of hospitality and their guest. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'>[266]</a></span>
troop of gendarmes returned without accomplishing their object.
When the report spread that King Murat had appealed
to the hospitality of the Corsicans, and that his person was
threatened, the people flocked in arms from all the villages in
the neighbourhood, and formed a camp at Vescovato for the
protection of their guest, so that on the following day Murat
saw himself at the head of a small army. Poor Joachim
was enchanted with the <span lang='it_IT'><i>evvivas</i></span> of the Corsicans. It rested
entirely with himself whether he should assume the crown of
Corsica, but he thought only of his beautiful Naples. The
sight of a huzzaing crowd made him once more feel like a
king. "And if these Corsicans," said he, "who owe me nothing
in the world, exhibit such generous kindness, how will
my Neapolitans receive me, on whom I have conferred so
many benefits?"
</p>

<p>
His determination to regain Naples became immoveably
firm; the fate of Napoleon, after leaving the neighbouring
Elba, and landing as adventurer on the coast of France, did
not deter him. The son of fortune was resolved to try his last
throw, and play for a kingdom or death.
</p>

<p>
Great numbers of officers and gentlemen meanwhile visited
the house of the Ceccaldi from far and near, desirous of seeing
and serving Murat. He had formed his plan. He summoned
from Elba the Baron Barbarà, one of his old officers of Marine,
a Maltese who had fled to Porto Longone, in order to take definite
measures with the advice of one who was intimately
acquainted with the Calabrian coast. He secretly despatched
a Corsican to Naples, to form connexions and procure money
there. He purchased three sailing-vessels in Bastia, which
were to take him and his followers on board at Mariana,
but it came to the ears of the French, and they laid an embargo
on them. In vain did men of prudence and insight
warn Murat to desist from the foolhardy undertaking. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267'>[267]</a></span>
had conceived the idea&mdash;and nothing could convince him of his
mistake&mdash;that the Neapolitans were warmly attached to him,
that he only needed to set foot on the Calabrian coast, in
order to be conducted in triumph to his castle; and he was
encouraged in this belief by men who came to him from
Naples, and told him that King Ferdinand was hated there,
and that people longed for nothing so ardently as to have
Murat again for their king.
</p>

<p>
Two English officers appeared in Bastia, from Genoa; they
came to Vescovato, and made offer to King Joachim of a safe
conduct to England. But Murat indignantly refused the offer,
remembering how England had treated Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile his position in Vescovato became more and more
dangerous, and his generous hosts Ceccaldi and Franceschetti
were now also seriously menaced, as the Bourbonist commandant
had issued a proclamation which declared all those
who attached themselves to Joachim Murat, or received him
into their houses, enemies and traitors to their country.
</p>

<p>
Murat, therefore, concluded to leave Vescovato as soon as
possible. He still negotiated for the restoration of his sequestrated
vessels; he had recourse to Antonio Galloni, commandant
of Balagna, whose brother he had formerly loaded
with kindnesses. Galloni sent him back the answer, that he
could do nothing in the matter; that, on the contrary, he had
received orders from Verrière to march on the following day
with six hundred men to Vescovato, and take him prisoner;
that, however, out of consideration for his misfortunes, he
would wait four days, pledging himself not to molest him,
provided he left Vescovato within that time.
</p>

<p>
When Captain Moretti returned to Vescovato with this
reply, and unable to hold out any prospect of the recovery of
the vessels, Murat shed tears. "Is it possible," he cried,
"that I am so unfortunate! I purchase ships in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
leave Corsica, and the Government seizes them; I burn with
impatience to quit the island, and find every path blocked up.
Be it so! I will send away those brave men who so generously
guard me&mdash;I will stay here alone&mdash;I will bare my
breast to Galloni, or I will find means to release myself from
the bitter and cruel fate that persecutes me"&mdash;and here he
looked at the pistols lying on the table. Franceschetti had
entered the room; with emotion he said to Murat that the
Corsicans would never suffer him to be harmed. "And I,"
replied Joachim, "cannot suffer Corsica to be endangered or
embarrassed on my account; I must be gone!"
</p>

<p>
The four days had elapsed, and Galloni showed himself
with his troops before Vescovato. But the people stood ready
to give him battle; they opened fire. Galloni withdrew; for
Murat had just left the village.
</p>

<p>
It was on the 17th of September that he left Vescovato,
accompanied by Franceschetti, and some officers and veterans,
and escorted by more than five hundred armed Corsicans. He
had resolved to go to Ajaccio and embark there. Wherever
he showed himself&mdash;in the Casinca, in Tavagna, in Moriani,
in Campoloro, and beyond the mountains, the people crowded
round him and received him with <span lang='it_IT'><i>evvivas</i></span>. The inhabitants
of each commune accompanied him to the boundaries of the
next. In San Pietro di Venaco, the priest Muracciole met
him with a numerous body of followers, and presented to him
a beautiful Corsican horse. In a moment Murat had leapt
upon its back, and was galloping along the road, proud and
fiery, as when, in former days of more splendid fortune, he
galloped through the streets of Milan, of Vienna, of Berlin, of
Paris, of Naples, and over so many battle-fields.
</p>

<p>
In Vivario he was entertained by the old parish priest
Pentalacci, who had already, during a period of forty years, extended
his hospitality to so many fugitives&mdash;had received, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'>[269]</a></span>
these eventful times, Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Corsicans,
and had once even sheltered the young Napoleon, when his
life was threatened by the Paolists. As they sat at breakfast,
Joachim asked the old man what he thought of his design
on Naples. "I am a poor parish priest," said Pentalacci,
"and understand neither war nor diplomacy; but I am inclined
to doubt whether your Majesty is likely to win a crown
<i>now</i>, which you could not keep formerly when you were at
the head of an army." Murat replied with animation: "I
am as certain of again winning my kingdom, as I am of holding
this handkerchief in my hand."
</p>

<p>
Joachim sent Franceschetti on before, to ascertain how
people were likely to receive him in Ajaccio,&mdash;for the relatives
of Napoleon, in that town, had taken no notice of him
since his arrival in the island; and he had, therefore, already
made up his mind to stay in Bocognano till all was ready for
the embarkation. Franceschetti, however, wrote to him, that
the citizens of Ajaccio would be overjoyed to see him within
their walls, and that they pressingly invited him to come.
</p>

<p>
On the 23d of September, at four o'clock in the afternoon,
Murat entered Ajaccio for the second time in his life; he had
entered it the first time covered with glory&mdash;an acknowledged
hero in the eyes of all the world&mdash;for it was when he landed
with Napoleon, as the latter returned from Egypt. At his
entry now the bells were rung, the people saluted him with
<span lang='fr_FR'><i>vivats</i></span>, bonfires burned in the streets, and the houses were
illuminated. But the authorities of the city instantly quitted
it, and Napoleon's relations&mdash;the Ramolino family&mdash;also withdrew;
the Signora Paravisini alone had courage and affection
enough to remain, to embrace her relative, and to offer
him hospitality in her own house. Murat thought fit to live
in a public locanda.
</p>

<p>
The garrison of the citadel of Ajaccio was Corsican, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>[270]</a></span>
therefore friendly to Joachim. The commandant shut it up
within the fortress, and declared the town in a state of siege.
Murat now made the necessary preparations for his departure;
previously to which he drew up a proclamation addressed to
the Neapolitan people, consisting of thirty-six articles; it was
printed in Ajaccio.
</p>

<p>
On the 28th of September, an English officer named Maceroni,<a name='FA_M' id='FA_M' href='#FN_M' class='fnanchor'>[M]</a>
made his appearance, and requested an audience of
Joachim. He had brought passes for him from Metternich,
signed by the latter, by Charles Stuart, and by Schwarzenberg.
They were made out in the name of Count Lipona,
under which name&mdash;an anagram of Napoli&mdash;security to his
person and an asylum in German Austria or Bohemia were
guaranteed him. Murat entertained Maceroni at table; the
conversation turned upon Napoleon's last campaign, and the
battle of Waterloo, of which Maceroni gave a circumstantial
account, praising the cool bravery of the English infantry,
whose squares the French cavalry had been unable to break.
Murat said: "Had I been there, I am certain I should have
broken them;" to which Maceroni replied: "Your Majesty
would have broken the squares of the Prussians and Austrians,
but never those of the English." Full of fire Murat cried&mdash;"And
I should have broken those of the English too: for
Europe knows that I never yet found a square, of whatever
description, that I did not break!"
</p>

<p>
Murat accepted Metternich's passes, and at first pretended
to agree to the proposal; then he said that he must go to
Naples to conquer his kingdom. Maceroni begged of him
with tears to desist while it was yet time. But the king dismissed
him.
</p>

<p>
On the same day, towards midnight, the unhappy Murat
embarked, and, as his little squadron left the harbour of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>[271]</a></span>
Ajaccio, several cannon-shots were fired at it from the citadel,
by order of the commandant; it was said the cannons had
only been loaded with powder. The expedition consisted of
five small vessels besides a fast-sailing felucca called the
Scorridora, under the command of Barbarà, and in these there
were in all two hundred men, inclusive of subaltern officers,
twenty-two officers, and a few sailors.
</p>

<p>
The voyage was full of disasters. Fortune&mdash;that once more
favoured Napoleon when, seven months previously, he sailed
from Elba with his six ships and eight hundred men to regain his
crown&mdash;had no smiles for Murat. It is touching to see how the
poor ex-king, his heart tossed with anxieties and doubts, hovers
hesitatingly on the Calabrian coast; how he is forsaken by
his ships, and repelled as if by the warning hand of fate from
the unfriendly shore; how he is even at one time on the point
of making sail for Trieste, and saving himself in Austria, and
yet how at last the chivalrous dreamer, his mental vision
haunted unceasingly by the deceptive semblance of a crown,
adopts the fantastic and fatal resolution of landing in Pizzo.
</p>

<p>
"Murat," said the man who told me so much of Murat's
days in Ajaccio, and who had been an eye-witness of what
passed then, "was a brilliant cavalier with very little brains."
It is true enough. He was the hero of a historical romance,
and you cannot read the story of his life without being profoundly
stirred. He sat his horse better than a throne. He
had never learnt to govern; he had only, what born kings frequently
have not, a kingly bearing, and the courage to be a king;
and he was most a king when he had ceased to be acknowledged
as such: this <span lang='fr_FR'><i>ci-devant</i></span> waiter in his father's tavern,
Abbé, and cashiered subaltern, fronted his executioners more
regally than Louis XVI., of the house of Capet, and died not
less proudly than Charles of England, of the house of Stuart.
</p>

<p>
A servant showed me the rooms in Franceschetti's in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272'>[272]</a></span>
Murat had lived. The walls were hung with pictures of the
battles in which he had signalized himself, such as Marengo,
Eylau, the military engagement at Aboukir, and Borodino. His
portrait caught my eye instantly. The impassioned and dreamy
eye, the brown curling hair falling down over the forehead, the
soft romantic features, the fantastic white dress, the red scarf,
were plainly Joachim's. Under the portrait I read these
words&mdash;"1815. <span lang='it_IT'><i>Tradito!!! abbandonato!!! li 13 Octobre assassinato!!!</i></span>"
(betrayed, forsaken; on the 13th of October,
murdered);&mdash;groanings of Franceschetti's, who had accompanied
him to Pizzo. The portrait of the General hangs
beside that of Murat, a high warlike form, with a physiognomy
of iron firmness, contrasting forcibly with the troubadour face
of Joachim. Franceschetti sacrificed his all for Murat&mdash;he
left wife and child to follow him; and although he disapproved
of the undertaking of his former king, kept by his side to the last.
An incident which was related to me, and which I also saw
mentioned in the General's <span lang='fr_FR'><i>Mémoires</i></span>, indicates great nobility of
character, and does honour to his memory. When the rude soldiery
of Pizzo were pressing in upon Murat, threatening him
with the most brutal maltreatment, Franceschetti sprang forward
and cried, "I&mdash;I am Murat!" The stroke of a sabre
stretched him on the earth, just as Murat rushed to intercept it
by declaring who he was. All the officers and soldiers who were
taken prisoners with Murat at Pizzo were thrown into prison,
wounded or not, as it might happen. After Joachim's execution,
they and Franceschetti were taken to the citadel of Capri, where
they remained for a considerable time, in constant expectation
of death, till at length the king sent the unhoped-for order for
their release. Franceschetti returned to Corsica; but he had
scarcely landed, when he was seized by the French as guilty
of high treason, and carried away to the citadel of Marseilles.
The unfortunate man remained a prisoner in Provence for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'>[273]</a></span>
several years, but was at length set at liberty, and allowed to
return to his family in Vescovato. His fortune had been
ruined by Murat; and this general, who had risked his life
for his king, saw himself compelled to send his wife to
Vienna to obtain from the wife of Joachim a partial re-imbursement
of his outlay, and, as the journey proved fruitless, to
enter into a protracted law-process with Caroline Murat, in
which he was nonsuited at every stage. Franceschetti died
in 1836. His two sons, retired officers, are among the most
highly respected men in Corsica, and have earned the gratitude
of their countrymen by the improvements they have introduced
in agriculture.
</p>

<p>
His wife, Catharina Ceccaldi, now far advanced in years,
still lives in the same house in which she once entertained
Murat as her guest. I found the noble old lady in one of the
upper rooms, engaged in a very homely employment, and surrounded
with pigeons, which fluttered out of the window as
I entered; a scene which made me feel instantly that the
healthy and simple nature of the Corsicans has been preserved
not only in the cottages of the peasantry, but also among the
upper classes. I thought of her brilliant youth, which she
had spent in the beautiful Naples, and at the court of
Joachim; and in the course of the conversation she herself
referred to the time when General Franceschetti, and Coletta,
who has also published a special memoir on the last days of
Murat, were in the service of the Neapolitan soldier-king.
It is pleasant to see a strong nature that has victoriously
weathered the many storms of an eventful life, and has remained
true to itself when fortune became false; and I contemplated
this venerable matron with reverence, as, talking
of the great things of the past, she carefully split the beans
for the mid-day meal of her children and grandchildren.
She spoke of the time, too, when Murat lived in the house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274'>[274]</a></span>
"Franceschetti," she said, "made the most forcible representations
to him, and told him unreservedly that he was undertaking
an impossibility. Then Murat would say sorrowfully,
'You, too, want to leave me! Ah! my Corsicans are going
to leave me in the lurch!' We could not resist him."
</p>

<p>
Leaving Vescovato, and wandering farther into the Casinca,
I still could not cease thinking on Murat. And I could not
help connecting him with the romantic Baron Theodore von
Neuhoff, who, seventy-nine years earlier, landed on this same
coast, strangely and fantastically costumed, as it had also
been Murat's custom to appear. Theodore von Neuhoff was
the forerunner in Corsica of those men who conquered for
themselves the fairest crowns in the world. Napoleon obtained
the imperial crown, Joseph the crown of Spain, Louis
the crown of Holland, Jerome the crown of Westphalia&mdash;the
land of which Theodore King of Corsica was a native,&mdash;the
adventurer Murat secured the Norman crown of the Two
Sicilies, and Bernadotte the crown of the chivalrous Scandinavians,
the oldest knights of Europe. A hundred years
<i>before</i> Theodore, Cervantes had satirized, in his Sancho Panza,
the romancing practice of conferring island kingdoms in
reward for conquering prowess, and now, a hundred years
<i>after</i> him, the romance of <i>Arthur and the Round Table</i> repeats
itself here on the boundaries of Spain, in the island of
Corsica, and continues to be realized in the broad daylight of
the nineteenth century, and our own present time.
</p>

<p>
I often thought of Don Quixote and the Spanish romances
in Corsica. It seems to me as if the old knight of La Mancha
were once more riding through the world's history; in fact,
are not antique Spanish names again becoming historical,
which were previously for the world at large involved in as
much romantic obscurity as the Athenian Duke Theseus of
the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>?

VENZOLASCA&mdash;CASABIANCA&mdash;THE OLD CLOISTER.

</div></div></div>

<p>
Near Vescovato lies the little hamlet of Venzolasca. It is
a walk as if through paradise, over the hills to it through the
chestnut-groves. On my way I passed the forsaken Capuchin
convent of Vescovato. Lying on a beautifully-wooded height,
built of brown granite, and roofed with black slate, it looked
as grave and austere as Corsican history itself, and had a singularly
quaint and picturesque effect amid the green of the trees.
</p>

<p>
In travelling through this little "Land of Chestnuts," one
forgets all fatigues. The luxuriance of the vegetation, and
the smiling hills, the view of the plain of the Golo, and the
sea, make the heart glad; the vicinity of numerous villages
gives variety and human interest, furnishing many a group
that would delight the eye of the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>genre</i></span> painter. I saw a
great many walled fountains, at which women and girls were
filling their round pitchers; some of them had their spindles
with them, and reminded me of what Peter of Corsica has said.
</p>

<p>
Outside Venzolasca stands a beautifully situated tomb belonging
to the Casabianca family. This is another of the
noble and influential families which Vescovato can boast.
The immediate ancestors of the present French senator Casabianca
made their name famous by their deeds of arms. Raffaello
Casabianca, commandant of Corsica in 1793, Senator,
Count, and Peer of France, died in Bastia at an advanced
age in 1826. Luzio Casabianca, Corsican deputy to the
Convention, was captain of the admiral's ship, <span lang='fr_FR'><i>L'Orient</i></span>, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>[276]</a></span>
the battle of Aboukir. After Admiral Brueys had been torn
in pieces by a shot, Casabianca took the command of the
vessel, which was on fire, the flames spreading rapidly. As
far as was possible, he took measures for saving the crew, and
refused to leave the ship. His young son Giocante, a boy of
thirteen, could not be prevailed on to leave his father's side.
The vessel was every moment expected to blow up. Clasped
in each other's arms, father and son perished in the explosion.
You can wander nowhere in Corsica without breathing an
atmosphere of heroism.
</p>

<p>
Venzolasca has a handsome church, at least interiorly. I
found people engaged in painting the choir, and they complained
to me that the person who had been engaged to
gild the wood-carving, had shamefully cheated the village, as
he had been provided with ducat-gold for the purpose, and
had run off with it. The only luxury the Corsicans allow
themselves is in the matter of church-decoration, and there
is hardly a paese in the island, however poor, which does not
take a pride in decking its little church with gay colours and
golden ornaments.
</p>

<p>
From the plateau on which the church of Venzolasca stands,
there is a magnificent view seawards, and, in the opposite direction,
you have the indescribably beautiful basin of the Castagniccia.
Few regions of Corsica have given me so much pleasure
as the hills which enclose this basin in their connexion
with the sea. The Castagniccia is an imposing amphitheatre,
mountains clothed in the richest green, and of the finest forms,
composing the sides. The chestnut-woods cover them almost
to their summit; at their foot olive-groves, with their silver
gray, contrast picturesquely with the deep green of the chestnut
foliage. Half-appearing through the trees are seen scattered
hamlets, Sorbo, Penta, Castellare, and far up among the clouds
Oreto, dark, with tall black church-towers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'>[277]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The sun was westering as I ascended these hills, and the
hours of that afternoon were memorably beautiful. Again I
passed a forsaken cloister&mdash;this time, of the Franciscans. It
lay quite buried among vines, and foliage of every kind, dense,
yet not dense enough to conceal the abounding fruit. As I
passed into the court, and was entering the church of the convent,
my eye lighted on a melancholy picture of decay, which
Nature, with her luxuriance of vegetation, seemed laughingly
to veil. The graves were standing open, as if those once
buried there had rent the overlying stones, that they might
fly to heaven; skulls lay among the long green grass and
trailing plants, and the cross&mdash;the symbol of all sorrow&mdash;had
sunk amid a sea of flowers.

HOSPITALITY AND FAMILY LIFE IN ORETO&mdash;THE CORSICAN ANTIGONE.
</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"To Jove belong the stranger and the hungry,</p>
<p>
And though the gift be small, it cheers the heart."&mdash;<i>Odyssey.</i></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
An up-hill walk of two hours between fruit-gardens, the walls
of which the beautiful wreaths of the clematis garlanded all
the way along, and then through groves of chestnuts, brought
me to Oreto.
</p>

<p>
The name is derived from the Greek oros, which means
<i>mountain</i>; the place lies high and picturesque, on the summit
of a green hill. A huge block of granite rears its gray
head from the very centre of the village, a pedestal for the
colossal statue of a Hercules. Before reaching the paese, I had
to climb a laborious and narrow path, which at many parts
formed the channel of a brook.
</p>

<p>
At length gaining the summit, I found myself in the piazza,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>[278]</a></span>
or public square of the village, the largest I have seen in any
paese. It is the plateau of the mountain, overhung by other
mountains, and encircled by houses, which look like peace
itself. The village priest was walking about with his beadle,
and the <span lang='it_IT'><i>paesani</i></span> stood leaning in the Sabbath-stillness on their
garden walls. I stepped up to a group and asked if there was
a locanda in the place; "No," said one, "we have no locanda,
but I offer you my house&mdash;you shall have what we can give."
I gladly accepted the offer, and followed my host. Marcantonio,
before I entered his house, wished that I should take
a look of the village fountain, the pride of Oreto, and taste
the water, the best in the whole land of Casinca. Despite
my weariness, I followed the Corsican. The fountain was delicious,
and the little structure could even make pretensions to
architectural elegance. The ice-cold water streamed copiously
through five pipes from a stone temple.
</p>

<p>
Arrived in Marcantonio's house, I was welcomed by his
wife without ceremony. She bade me a good evening, and
immediately went into the kitchen to prepare the meal. My
entertainer had conducted me into his best room, and I was
astonished to find there a little store of books; they were of a
religious character, and the legacy of a relative. "I am unfortunate,"
said Marcantonio, "for I have learnt nothing, and
I am very poor; hence I must stay here upon the mountain,
instead of going to the Continent, and filling some post." I
looked more narrowly at this man in the brown blouse and
Phrygian cap. The face was reserved, furrowed with passion,
and of an iron austerity, and what he said was brief, decided,
and in a bitter tone. All the time I was in his company, I
never once saw this man smile; and found here, among the
solitary hills, an ambitious soul tormented with its thwarted
aspirations. Such minds are not uncommon in Corsica; the
frequent success of men who have emigrated from these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279'>[279]</a></span>
poor villages is a powerful temptation to others; often in
the dingiest cabin you see the family likenesses of senators,
generals, and prefects. Corsica is the land of upstarts and of
natural equality.
</p>

<p>
Marcantonio's daughter, a pretty young girl, blooming, tall,
and well-made, entered the room. Without taking any other
notice of the presence of a guest, she asked aloud, and with
complete <span lang='fr_FR'><i>naïveté</i></span>: "Father, who is the stranger, is he a Frenchman;
what does he want in Oreto?" I told her I was a German,
which she did not understand. Giulia went to help her
mother with the meal.
</p>

<p>
This now made its appearance&mdash;the most sumptuous a poor
man could give&mdash;a soup of vegetables, and in honour of the
guest a piece of meat, bread, and peaches. The daughter set
the viands on the table, but, according to the Corsican custom,
neither she nor the mother took a share in the meal; the man
alone helped me, and ate beside me.
</p>

<p>
He took me afterwards into the little church of Oreto, and
to the edge of the rock, to show me the incomparably beautiful
view. The young curato, and no small retinue of <span lang='it_IT'><i>paesani</i></span>,
accompanied us. It was a sunny, golden, delightfully cool
evening. I stood wonderstruck at such undreamt-of magnificence
in scenery as the landscape presented&mdash;for at my feet
I saw the hills, with all their burden of chestnut woods, sink
towards the plain; the plain, like a boundless garden, stretch
onwards to the strand; the streams of the Golo and Fiumalto
wind through it to the glittering sea; and far on the horizon,
the islands of Capraja, Elba, and Monte Chiato. The eye
takes in the whole coast-line to Bastia, and southwards to San
Nicolao; turning inland, mountain upon mountain, crowned
with villages.

<p>
A little group had gathered round us as we stood here; and I
now began to panegyrize the island, rendered, as I said, so remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>[280]</a></span>
by its scenery and by the history of its heroic people.
The young curate spoke in the same strain with great fire, the
peasants gesticulated their assent, and each had something to
say in praise of his country. I observed that these people
were much at home in the history of their island. The
curate excited my admiration; he had intellect, and talked
shrewdly. Speaking of Paoli, he said: "His time was a time
of action; the men of Orezza spoke little, but they did much.
Had our era produced a single individual of Paoli's large and
self-sacrificing spirit, it would be otherwise in the world than
it is. But ours is an age of chimeras and Icarus-wings, and
yet man was not made to fly." I gladly accepted the curate's
invitation to go home with him; his house was poor-looking,
built of black stone. But his little study was neat and cheerful;
and there might be between two and three hundred volumes
on the book-shelves. I spent a pleasant hour in conversation
with this cultivated, liberal, and enlightened man, over
a bottle of exquisite wine, Marcantonio sitting silent and
reserved. We happened to speak of Aleria, and I put a question
about Roman antiquities in Corsica. Marcantonio suddenly
put in his word, and said very gravely and curtly&mdash;"We
have no need of the fame of Roman antiquities&mdash;that
of our own forefathers is sufficient."
</p>

<p>
Returning to Marcantonio's house, I found in the room
both mother and daughter, and we drew in round the table
in sociable family circle. The women were mending clothes,
were talkative, unconstrained, and <span lang='fr_FR'><i>naïve</i></span>, like all Corsicans.
The unresting activity of the Corsican women is well known.
Subordinating themselves to the men, and uncomplainingly
accepting a menial position, the whole burden of whatever
work is necessary rests upon them. They share this lot with
the women of all warlike nations; as, for example, of the
Servians and Albanians.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281'>[281]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I described to them the great cities of the Continent, their
usages and festivals, more particularly some customs of my
native country. They never expressed astonishment, although
what they heard was utterly strange to them, and Giulia had
never yet seen a city, not even Bastia. I asked the girl how
old she was. "I am twenty years old," she said.
</p>

<p>
"That is impossible. You are scarce seventeen."
</p>

<p>
"She is sixteen years old," said the mother.
</p>

<p>
"What! do you not know your own birthday, Giulia?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but it stands in the register, and the Maire will
know it."
</p>

<p>
The Maire, therefore&mdash;happy man!&mdash;is the only person who
can celebrate the birthday of the pretty Giulia&mdash;that is, if he
chooses to put his great old horn-spectacles on his nose, and
turn over the register for it.
</p>

<p>
"Giulia, how do you amuse yourself? young people must
be merry."
</p>

<p>
"I have always enough to do; my brothers want something
every minute; on Sunday I go to mass."
</p>

<p>
"What fine clothes will you wear to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall put on the faldetta."
</p>

<p>
She brought the faldetta from a press, and put it on; the
girl looked very beautiful in it. The faldetta is a long garment,
generally black, the end of which is thrown up behind
over the head, so that it has some resemblance to the hooded
cloak of a nun. To elderly women, the faldetta imparts dignity;
when it wraps the form of a young girl, its ample folds
add the charm of mystery.
</p>

<p>
The women asked me what I was. That was difficult to
answer. I took out my very unartistic sketch-book; and as
I turned over its leaves, I told them I was a painter.
</p>

<p>
"Have you come into the village," asked Giulia, "to colour
the walls?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I laughed loudly and heartily; the question was an apt
criticism of my Corsican sketches. Marcantonio said very
seriously&mdash;"Don't; she does not understand such things."
</p>

<p>
These Corsican women have as yet no notion of the arts
and sciences; they read no romances, they play the cithern in
the twilight, and sing a melancholy vocero&mdash;a beautiful dirge,
which, perhaps, they themselves improvise. But in the little
circle of their ideas and feelings, their nature remains vigorous
and healthy as the nature that environs them&mdash;chaste, and
pious, and self-balanced, capable of all noble sacrifice, and
such heroic resolves, as the poetry of civilisation preserves to
all time as the highest examples of human magnanimity.
</p>

<p>
Antigone and Iphigenia can be matched in Corsica. There
is not a single high-souled act of which the record has descended
to us from antiquity but this uncultured people can
place a deed of equal heroism by its side.
</p>

<p>
In honour of our young Corsican Giulia, I shall relate the
following story. It is historical fact, like every other Corsican
tale that I shall tell.
</p>

<h3>
THE CORSICAN ANTIGONE.
</h3>

<p>
It was about the end of the year 1768. The French had
occupied Oletta, a considerable village in the district of
Nebbio. As from the nature of its situation it was a post of
the highest importance, Paoli put himself in secret communication
with the inhabitants, and formed a plan for surprising
the French garrison and making them prisoners. They were
fifteen hundred in number, and commanded by the Marquis of
Arcambal. But the French were upon their guard; they proclaimed
martial law in Oletta, and maintained a strict and
watchful rule, so that the men of the village did not venture
to attempt anything.
</p>

<p>
Oletta was now still as the grave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One day a young man named Giulio Saliceti left his village
to go into the Campagna, without the permission of the French
guard. On his return he was seized and thrown into prison;
after a short time, however, he was set at liberty.
</p>

<p>
The youth left his prison and took his way homewards, full
of resentment at the insult put upon him by the enemy. He
was noticed to mutter something to himself, probably curses
directed against the hated French. A sergeant heard him, and
gave him a blow in the face. This occurred in front of the
youth's house, at a window of which one of his relatives happened
to be standing&mdash;the Abbot Saliceti namely, whom the
people called Peverino, or Spanish Pepper, from his hot and
headlong temper. When Peverino saw the stroke fall upon
his kinsman's face, his blood boiled in his veins.
</p>

<p>
Giulio rushed into the house quite out of himself with
shame and anger, and was immediately taken by Peverino
into his chamber. After some time the two men were seen
to come out, calm, but ominously serious.
</p>

<p>
At night, other men secretly entered the house of the Saliceti,
sat together and deliberated. And what they deliberated
on was this: they proposed to blow up the church of Oletta,
which the French had turned into their barracks. They were
determined to have revenge and their liberty.
</p>

<p>
They dug a mine from Saliceti's house, terminating beneath
the church, and filled it with all the powder they had.
</p>

<p>
The date fixed for firing the mine was the 13th of February
1769, towards night.
</p>

<p>
Giulio had nursed his wrath till there was as little pity in
his heart as in a musket-bullet. "To-morrow!" he said
trembling, "to-morrow! Let me apply the match; they
struck me in the face; I will give them a stroke that shall
strike them as high as the clouds. I will blast them out
of Oletta, as if the bolts of heaven had got among them!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'>[284]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"But the women and children, and those who do not know
of it? The explosion will carry away every house in the
neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
"They must be warned. They must be directed under this
or the other pretext to go to the other end of the village at
the hour fixed, and that in all quietness."
</p>

<p>
The conspirators gave orders to this effect.
</p>

<p>
Next evening, when the dreadful hour arrived, old men and
young, women, children, were seen betaking themselves in
silence and undefined alarm, with secrecy and speed, to the
other end of the village, and there assembling.
</p>

<p>
The suspicions of the French began to be aroused, and a
messenger from General Grand-Maison came galloping in,
and communicated in breathless haste the information which
his commander had received. Some one had betrayed the
plot. That instant the French threw themselves on Saliceti's
house and the powder-mine, and crushed the hellish undertaking.
</p>

<p>
Saliceti and a few of the conspirators cut their way through
the enemy with desperate courage, and escaped in safety from
Oletta. Others, however, were seized and put in chains. A
court-martial condemned fourteen of these to death by the
wheel, and seven unfortunates were actually broken, in terms
of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
Seven corpses were exposed to public view, in the square
before the Convent of Oletta. No burial was to be allowed
them. The French commandant had issued an order that no
one should dare to remove any of the bodies from the scaffold
for interment, under pain of death.
</p>

<p>
Blank dismay fell upon the village of Oletta. Every heart
was chilled with horror. Not a human being stirred abroad;
the fires upon the hearths were extinguished&mdash;no voice was
heard but the voice of weeping. The people remained in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>[285]</a></span>
their houses, but their thoughts turned continually to the
square before the convent, where the seven corpses lay upon
the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
The first night came. Maria Gentili Montalti was sitting
on her bed in her chamber. She was not weeping; she sat
with her head hanging on her breast, her hands in her lap,
her eyes closed. Sometimes a profound sob shook her frame.
It seemed to her as if a voice called, through the stillness of
the night, O Marì!
</p>

<p>
The dead, many a time in the stillness of the night, call the
name of those whom they have loved. Whoever answers,
must die.
</p>

<p>
O Bernardo! cried Maria&mdash;for she wished to die.
</p>

<p>
Bernardo lay before the convent on the scaffold; he was
the seventh and youngest of the dead. He was Maria's lover,
and their marriage was fixed for the following month. Now
he lay dead upon the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
Maria Gentili stood silent in the dark chamber, she listened
towards the side where the convent lay, and her soul held
converse with a spirit. Bernardo seemed to implore of her a
Christian burial.
</p>

<p>
But whoever removed a corpse from the scaffold and buried
it, was to be punished by death. Maria was resolved to bury
her beloved and then die.
</p>

<p>
She softly opened the door of her chamber in order to leave
the house. She passed through the room in which her aged
parents slept. She went to their bedside and listened to their
breathing. Then her heart began to quail, for she was the only
child of her parents, and their sole support, and when she
thought how her death by the hand of the public executioner
would bow her father and mother down into the grave, her
soul shrank back in great pain, and she turned, and made a
step towards her chamber.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286'>[286]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At that moment she again heard the voice of her dead
lover wail: O Marì! O Marì! I loved thee so well, and now
thou forsakest me. In my mangled body lies the heart that
died still loving thee&mdash;bury me in the Church of St. Francis,
in the grave of my fathers, O Marì!
</p>

<p>
Maria opened the door of the house and passed out into the
night. With uncertain footsteps she gained the square of the
convent. The night was gloomy. Sometimes the storm came
and swept the clouds away, so that the moon shone down.
When its beams fell upon the convent, it was as if the light of
heaven refused to look upon what it there saw, and the moon
wrapped itself again in the black veil of clouds. For before
the convent a row of seven corpses lay on the red scaffold,
and the seventh was the corpse of a youth.
</p>

<p>
The owl and the raven screamed upon the tower; they
sang the vocero&mdash;the dirge for the dead. A grenadier was
walking up and down, with his musket on his shoulder, not
far off. No wonder that he shuddered to his inmost marrow,
and buried his face in his mantle, as he moved slowly up and
down.
</p>

<p>
Maria had wrapped herself in the black faldetta, that her
form might be the less distinct in the darkness of the night.
She breathed a prayer to the Holy Virgin, the Mother of Sorrows,
that she would help her, and then she walked swiftly to
the scaffold. It was the seventh body&mdash;she loosed Bernardo;
her heart, and a faint gleam from his dead face, told her that
it was he, even in the dark night. Maria took the dead man
in her arms, upon her shoulder. She had become strong, as
if with the strength of a man. She bore the corpse into the
Church of St. Francis.
</p>

<p>
There she sat down exhausted, on the steps of an altar,
over which the lamp of the Mother of God was burning.
The dead Bernardo lay upon her knees, as the dead Christ
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>[287]</a></span>
once lay upon the knees of Mary. In the south they call
this group Pietà.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound in the church. The lamp glimmers above
the altar. Outside, a gust of wind that whistles by.
</p>

<p>
Maria rose. She let the dead Bernardo gently down upon
the steps of the altar. She went to the spot where the grave
of Bernardo's parents lay. She opened the grave. Then
she took up the dead body. She kissed him, and lowered
him into the grave, and again shut it. Maria knelt long
before the Mother of God, and prayed that Bernardo's soul
might have peace in heaven; and then she went silently
away to her house, and to her chamber.
</p>

<p>
When morning broke, Bernardo's corpse was missing from
among the dead bodies before the convent. The news flew
through the village, and the soldiers drummed alarm. It
was not doubted that the Leccia family had removed their
kinsman during the night from the scaffold; and instantly
their house was forced, its inmates taken prisoners, and
thrown chained into a jail. Guilty of capital crime, according
to the law that had been proclaimed, they were to suffer
the penalty, although they denied the deed.
</p>

<p>
Maria Gentili heard in her chamber what had happened.
Without saying a word, she hastened to the house of the
Count de Vaux, who had come to Oletta. She threw herself
at his feet, and begged the liberation of the prisoners. She
confessed that it was she who had done that of which they
were supposed to be guilty. "I have buried my betrothed,"
said she; "death is my due, here is my head; but restore
their freedom to those that suffer innocently."
</p>

<p>
The Count at first refused to believe what he heard; for
he held it impossible both that a weak girl should be capable
of such heroism, and that she should have sufficient strength
to accomplish what Maria had accomplished. When he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>[288]</a></span>
convinced himself of the truth of her assertions, a thrill of
astonishment passed through him, and he was moved to tears.
"Go," said he, "generous-hearted girl, yourself release the
relations of your lover; and may God reward your heroism!"
</p>

<p>
On the same day the other six corpses were taken from the
scaffold, and received a Christian burial.

<br />
<br />

A RIDE THROUGH THE DISTRICT OF OREZZA TO MOROSAGLIA.
</h3>

<p>
I wished to go from Oreto to Morosaglia, Paoli's native
place, through Orezza. Marcantonio had promised to accompany
me, and to provide good horses. He accordingly awoke
me early in the morning, and made ready to go. He had
put on his best clothes, wore a velvet jacket, and had shaved
himself very smoothly. The women fortified us for the journey
with a good breakfast, and we mounted our little Corsican
horses, and rode proudly forth.
</p>

<p>
It makes my heart glad yet to think of that Sunday morning,
and the ride through this romantic and beautiful land of
Orezza&mdash;over the green hills, through cool dells, over gushing
brooks, through the green oak-woods. Far as the eye can
reach on every side, those shady, fragrant chestnut-groves;
those giants of trees, in size such as I had never seen before.
Nature has here done everything, man so little. His chestnuts
are often a Corsican's entire estate; and in many instances
he has only six goats and six chestnut-trees, which
yield him his polleta. Government has already entertained
the idea of cutting down the forests of chestnuts, in order to
compel the Corsican to till the ground; but this would amount
to starving him. Many of these trees have trunks twelve feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>[289]</a></span>
in thickness. With their full, fragrant foliage, long, broad,
dark leaves, and fibred, light-green fruit-husks, they are a
sight most grateful to the eye.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the paese of Casalta, we entered a singularly romantic
dell, through which the Fiumalto rushes. You find
everywhere here serpentine, and the exquisite marble called
Verde Antico. The engineers called the little district of
Orezza the elysium of geology; the waters of the stream roll
the beautiful stones along with them. Through endless balsamic
groves, up hill and down hill, we rode onwards to Piedicroce,
the principal town of Orezza, celebrated for its medicinal
springs; for Orezza, rich in minerals, is also rich in
mineral waters.
</p>

<p>
Francesco Marmocchi says, in his geography of the island:
"Mineral springs are the invariable characteristic of countries
which have been upheaved by the interior forces. Corsica,
which within a limited space presents the astonishing and
varied spectacle of the thousandfold workings of this ancient
struggle between the heated interior of the earth and its
cooled crust, was not likely to form an exception to this
general rule."
</p>

<p>
Corsica has, accordingly, its cold and its warm mineral
springs; and although these, so far as they have been counted,
are numerous, there can be no doubt that others still remain
undiscovered.
</p>

<p>
The natural phenomena of this beautiful island, and particularly
its mineralogy, have by no means as yet had sufficient
attention directed to them.
</p>

<p>
Up to the present time, fourteen mineral springs, warm
and cold, are accurately and fully known. The distribution
of these salubrious waters over the surface of the island, more
especially in respect to their temperature, is extremely unequal.
The region of the primary granite possesses eight, all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>[290]</a></span>
warm, and containing more or less sulphur, except one; while
the primary ophiolitic and calcareous regions possess only six,
one alone of which is warm.
</p>

<p>
The springs of Orezza, bursting forth at many spots, lie on
the right bank of the Fiumalto. The main spring is the only
one that is used; it is cold, acid, and contains iron. It
gushes out of a hill below Piedicroce in great abundance,
from a stone basin. No measures have been taken for the
convenience of strangers visiting the wells; these walk or ride
under their broad parasols down the hills into the green forest,
where they have planted their tents. After a ride of several
hours under the burning sun, and not under a parasol, I found
this vehemently effervescing water most delicious.
</p>

<p>
Piedicroce lies high. Its slender church-tower looks airily
down from the green hill. The Corsican churches among
the mountains frequently occupy enchantingly beautiful and
bold sites. Properly speaking, they stand already in the
heavens; and when the door opens, the clouds and the angels
might walk in along with the congregation.
</p>

<p>
A majestic thunderstorm was flaming round Piedicroce,
and echoed powerfully from hill to hill. We rode into the
paese to escape the torrents of rain. A young man, fashionably
dressed, sprang out of a house, and invited us to enter
his locanda. I found other two gentlemen within, with
daintily-trimmed beard and moustache, and of very active but
polished manners. They immediately wished to know my
commands; and nimble they were in executing them&mdash;one
whipped eggs, another brought wood and fire, the third minced
meat. The eldest of them had a nobly chiselled but excessively
pale face, with a long Slavonic moustache. So many
cooks to a simple meal, and such extremely genteel ones, I
was now for the first time honoured with. I was utterly
amazed till they told me who they were. They were two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291'>[291]</a></span>
fugitive Modenese, and a Hungarian. The Magyar told me,
as he stewed the meat, that he had been seven years lieutenant-general.
"Now I stand here and cook," he added;
"but such is the way of the world, when one has come to be
a poor devil in a foreign country, he must not stand on ceremony.
We have set up a locanda here for the season at the
wells, and have made very little by it."
</p>

<p>
As I looked at his pale face&mdash;he had caught fever at Aleria&mdash;I
felt touched.
</p>

<p>
We sat down together, Magyar, Lombard, Corsican, and
German, and talked of old times, and named many names of
modern celebrity or notoriety. How silent many of these become
before the one great name, Paoli! I dare not mention
them beside him; the noble citizen, the man of intellect and
action, will not endure their company.
</p>

<p>
The storm was nearly over, but the mountains still stood
plunged in mist. We mounted our horses in order to cross the
hills of San Pietro and reach Ampugnani. Thunder growled
and rolled among the misty summits, and clouds hung on every
side. A wild and dreary sadness lay heavily on the hills; now
and then still a flash of lightning; mountains as if sunk in a sea
of cloud, others stretching themselves upwards like giants;
wherever the veil rends, a rich landscape, green groves, black
villages&mdash;all this, as it seemed, flying past the rider; valley
and summit, cloister and tower, hill after hill, like dream-pictures
hanging among clouds. The wild elemental powers, that
sleep fettered in the soul of man, are ready at such moments
to burst their bonds, and rush madly forth. Who has not
experienced this mood on a wild sea, or when wandering
through the storm? and what we are then conscious of is the
same elemental power of nature that men call passion, when
it takes a determinate form. Forward, Antonio! Gallop the
little red horses along this misty hill, fast! faster! till clouds,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>[292]</a></span>
hills, cloisters, towers, fly with horse and rider. Hark! yonder
hangs a black church-tower, high up among the mists,
and the bells peal and peal Ave Maria&mdash;signal for the soul to
calm itself.
</p>

<p>
The villages are here small, picturesquely scattered everywhere
among the hills, lying high or in beautiful green
valleys. I counted from one point so many as seventeen,
with as many slender black church-towers. We passed numbers
of people on the road; men of the old historic land of
Orezza and Rostino, noble and powerful forms; their fathers
once formed the guard of Paoli.
</p>

<p>
At Polveroso, we had a magnificent glimpse of a deep valley,
in the middle of which lies Porta, the principal town of the
little district of Ampugnani, embosomed in chestnuts, now
dripping with the thunder-shower. Here stood formerly
the ancient Accia, a bishopric, not a trace of which remains.
Porta is an unusually handsome place, and many of its little
houses resemble elegant villas. The small yellow church has
a pretty façade, and a surprisingly graceful tower stands, in
Tuscan fashion, as isolated campanile or belfry by its side.
From the hill of San Pietro, you look down into the rows of
houses, and the narrow streets that group themselves about
the church, as into a trim little theatre. Porta is the birthplace
of Sebastiani.
</p>

<p>
The mountains now become balder, and more severe in
form, losing the chestnuts that previously adorned them. I
found huge thistles growing by the roadside, large almost as
trees, with magnificent, broad, finely-cut leaves, and hard
woody stem. Marcantonio had sunk into complete silence.
The Corsicans speak little, like the Spartans; my host of
Oreto was dumb as Harpocrates. I had ridden with him a
whole day through the mountains, and, from morning till
evening had never been able to draw him into conversation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>[293]</a></span>
Only now and then he threw out some <span lang='fr_FR'><i>naïve</i></span> question: "Have
you cannons? Have you hells in your country? Do fruits
grow with you? Are you wealthy?"
</p>

<p>
After Ave Maria, we at length reached the canton of Rostino
or Morosaglia, the country of Paoli, the most illustrious
of all the localities celebrated in Corsican history, and the
central point of the old democratic Terra del Commune. We
were still upon the Campagna, when Marcantonio took leave
of me; he was going to pass the night in a house at some distance,
and return home with the horses on the morrow. He
gave me a brotherly kiss, and turned away grave and silent;
and I, happy to find myself in this land of heroes and free
men, wandered on alone towards the convent of Morosaglia.
I have still an hour on the solitary plain, and, before entering
Paoli's house, I shall continue the history of his people and
himself at the point where I left off.

After Pasquale Paoli and his brother Clemens, with their
companions, had left Corsica, the French easily made themselves
masters of the whole island. Only a few straggling
guerilla bands protracted the struggle a while longer among
the mountains. Among these, one noble patriot especially
deserves the love and admiration of future times&mdash;the poor
parish priest of Guagno&mdash;Domenico Leca, of the old family
of Giampolo. He had sworn upon the Gospels to abide true
to freedom, and to die sooner than give up the struggle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>[294]</a></span>
When the whole country had submitted, and the enemy summoned
him to lay down his arms, he declared that he could
not violate his oath. He dismissed those of his people that
did not wish any longer to follow him, and threw himself,
with a faithful few, into the hills. For months he continued
the struggle, fighting, however, only when he was attacked,
and tending wounded foes with Christian compassion when
they fell into his hands. He inflicted injury on none except
in honourable conflict. In vain the French called on him to
come down, and live unmolested in his village. The priest of
Guagno wandered among the mountains, for he was resolved
to be free; and when all had forsaken him, the goat-herds gave
him shelter and sustenance. But one day he was found dead
in a cave, whence he had gone home to his Master, weary and
careworn, and a free man. A relative of Paoli and friend of
Alfieri&mdash;Giuseppe Ottaviano Savelli&mdash;has celebrated the memory
of the priest of Guagno in a Latin poem, with the title
of <span lang='la'><i>Vir Nemoris</i></span>&mdash;The Man of the Forest.
</p>

<p>
Other Corsicans, too, who had gone into exile to Italy,
landed here and there, and attempted, like their forefathers,
Vincentello, Renuccio, Giampolo, and Sampiero, to free the
island. None of these attempts met with any success. Many
Corsicans were barbarously dragged off to prison&mdash;many sent
to the galleys at Toulon, as if they had been helots who had
revolted against their masters. Abattucci, who had been
one of the last to lay down arms, falsely accused of high
treason and convicted, was condemned in Bastia to branding
and the galleys. When Abattucci was sitting upon the
scaffold ready to endure the execution of the sentence, the
executioner shrank from applying the red-hot iron. "Do
your duty," cried a French judge; the man turned round to
the latter, and stretched the iron towards him, as if about to
brand the judge. Some time after, Abattucci was pardoned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295'>[295]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Count Marb&oelig;uf had succeeded the Count de
Vaux in the command of Corsica. His government was on
the whole mild and beneficial; the ancient civic regulations
of the Corsicans, and their statutes, remained in force; the
Council of Twelve was restored, and the administration of
justice rendered more efficient. Efforts were also made to animate
agriculture, and the general industry of the now utterly
impoverished country. Marb&oelig;uf died in Bastia in 1786,
after governing Corsica for sixteen years.
</p>

<p>
When the French Revolution broke out, that mighty movement
absorbed all private interests of the Corsicans, and
these ardent lovers of liberty threw themselves with enthusiasm
into the current of the new time. The Corsican deputy,
Saliceti, proposed that the island should be incorporated with
France, in order that it might share in her constitution. This
took place, in terms of a decree of the Legislative Assembly, on
the 30th of November 1789, and excited universal exultation
throughout Corsica. Most singular and contradictory was the
turn affairs had taken. The same France, that twenty years
before had sent out her armies to annihilate the liberties and
the constitution of Corsica, now raised that constitution upon
her throne!
</p>

<p>
The Revolution recalled Paoli from his exile. He had
gone first to Tuscany, and thereafter to London, where the
court and ministers had given him an honourable reception.
He lived very retired in London, and little was heard of his
life or his employment. Paoli made no stir when he came to
England; the great man who had led the van for Europe on
her new career, withdrew into silence and obscurity in his
little house in Oxford Street. He made no magniloquent
speeches. All he could do was to act like a man, and, when that
was no longer permitted him, be proudly silent. The scholar of
Corte had said in his presence, in the oration from which I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'>[296]</a></span>
have quoted: "If freedom were to be gained by mere talking,
then were the whole world free." Something might be learned
from the wisdom of this young student. When Napoleon,
like a genuine Corsican, taking refuge as a last resource in
an appeal to hospitality, claimed that of England from on
board the Bellerophon, he compared himself to Themistocles
when in the position of a suppliant for protection. He was
not entitled to compare himself with the great citizen of
Greece; Pasquale Paoli alone was that exiled Themistocles!
</p>

<p>
Here are one or two letters of this period:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
PAOLI TO HIS BROTHER CLEMENS,
</p>

<p class="center s08">
(<i>Who had remained in Tuscany.</i>)
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>Oct. 3, 1769</i>.&mdash;I have received no letters from
you. I fear they have been intercepted, for our enemies are
very adroit at such things.... I was well received by the
king and queen. The ministers have called upon me. This
reception has displeased certain foreign ministers: I hear
they have lodged protests. I have promised to go on Sunday
into the country to visit the Duke of Gloucester, who is our
warm friend. I hope to obtain something here for the support
of our exiled fellow-countrymen, if Vienna does nothing.
The eyes of people here are beginning to be opened; they
acknowledge the importance of Corsica. The king has spoken
to me very earnestly of the affair; his kindness to me personally
made me feel embarrassed. My reception at court has
almost drawn upon me the displeasure of the opposition; so
that some of them have begun to lampoon me. Our enemies
sought to encourage them, letting it be understood with a mysterious
air, that I had sold our country; that I had bought an
estate in Switzerland with French gold, that our property had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>[297]</a></span>
not been touched by the French; and that they had an understanding
with these ministers, as they too are sold to France.
But I believe that all are now better informed; and every
one approved of my resolution not to mix myself up with the
designs of parties; but to further by all means that for which
it is my duty to labour, and for the advancement of which all
can unite, without compromising their individual relations.
</p>

<p>
"Send me an accurate list of all our friends who have gone
into banishment&mdash;we must not be afraid of expense; and send
me news of Corsica. The letters must come under the addresses
of private friends, otherwise they do not reach me.
I enjoy perfect health. This climate appears to me as yet
very mild.
</p>

<p>
"The Campagna is always quite green. He who has not
seen it can have no conception of the loveliness of spring. The
soil of England is crisped like the waves of the sea when the
wind moves them lightly. Men here, though excited by political
faction, live, as far as regards overt acts of violence, as
if they were the most intimate friends: they are benevolent,
sensible, generous in all things; and they are happy under a
constitution than which there can be no better. This city is
a world; and it is without doubt a finer town than all the
rest put together. Fleets seem to enter its river every moment;
I believe that Rome was neither greater nor richer.
What we in Corsica reckon in paoli, people here reckon in
guineas, that is, in louis-d'ors. I have written for a bill of
exchange; I have refused to hear of contributions intended
for me personally, till I know what conclusion they have come
to in regard to the others; but I know that their intentions
are good. In case they are obliged to temporize, finding their
hands tied at present, they will be ready the first war that
breaks out. I greet all; live happy, and do not think on
me."

CATHERINE OF RUSSIA TO PASQUALE PAOLI.
</p>

<p class="rjust">
"<span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <i>April 27, 1770</i>.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Monsieur General de Paoli!</span>&mdash;I have received your
letter from London, of the 15th February. All that Count
Alexis Orloff has let you know of my good intentions towards
you, Monsieur, is a result of the feelings with which your magnanimity,
and the high-spirited and noble manner in which
you have defended your country, have inspired me. I am
acquainted with the details of your residence in Pisa, and
with this among the rest, that you gained the esteem of all
those who had opportunities of intercourse with you. That is
the reward of virtue, in whatever situation it may find itself;
be assured that I shall always entertain the liveliest sympathy
for yours.
</p>

<p>
"The motive of your journey to England, was a natural
consequence of your sentiments with regard to your country.
Nothing is wanting to your good cause but favourable circumstances.
The natural interests of our empire, connected
as they are with those of Great Britain; the mutual friendship
between the two nations which results from this; the reception
which my fleets have met with on the same account, and
which my ships in the Mediterranean, and the commerce of
Russia, would have to expect from a free people in friendly
relations with my own, supply motives which cannot but be
favourable to you. You may, therefore, be assured, Monsieur,
that I shall not let slip the opportunities which will probably
occur, of rendering you all the good services that political conjunctures
may allow.
</p>

<p>
"The Turks have declared against me the most unjust war
that perhaps ever <i>has</i> been declared. At the present moment
I am only able to defend myself. The blessing of Heaven,
which has hitherto accompanied my cause, and which I pray
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299'>[299]</a></span>
God to continue to me, shows sufficiently that justice cannot
be long suppressed, and that patience, hope, and courage,
though the world is full of the most difficult situations,
nevertheless attain their aim. I receive with pleasure, Monsieur,
the assurances of regard which you are pleased to
express, and I beg you will be convinced of the esteem with
which I am,

<p>
Paoli had lived twenty long years an exile in London, when
he was summoned back to his native country. The Corsicans
sent him a deputation, and the French National Assembly,
in a pompous address, invited him to return.
</p>

<p>
On the 3d of April 1790, Paoli came for the first time to
Paris. He was fêted here as the Washington of Europe, and
Lafayette was constantly at his side. The National Assembly
received him with stormy acclamations, and elaborate oratory.
His reply was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Messieurs, this is the fairest and happiest day of my life.
I have spent my years in striving after liberty, and I find
here its noblest spectacle. I left my country in slavery, I find
it now in freedom. What more remains for me to desire?
After an absence of twenty years, I know not what alterations
tyranny may have produced among my countrymen; ah! it
cannot have been otherwise than fatal, for oppression demoralizes.
But in removing, as you have done, the chains from
the Corsicans, you have restored to them their ancient virtue.
Now that I am returning to my native country, you need entertain
no doubts as to the nature of my sentiments. You have
been magnanimous towards me, and I was never a slave. My
past conduct, which you have honoured with your approval, is
the pledge of my future course of action: my whole life, I may
say, has been an unbroken oath to liberty; it seems, therefore,
as if I had already sworn allegiance to the constitution which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300'>[300]</a></span>
you have established; but it still remains for me to give my
oath to the nation which adopts me, and to the monarch
whom I now acknowledge. This is the favour which I desire
of the august Assembly."
</p>

<p>
In the club of the Friends of the Constitution, Robespierre
thus addressed Paoli: "Ah! there was a time when we sought
to crush freedom in its last retreats. Yet no! that was the
crime of despotism&mdash;the French people have wiped away the
stain. What ample atonement to conquered Corsica, and
injured mankind! Noble citizens, you defended liberty at
a time when I did not so much as venture to hope for it.
You have suffered for liberty; you now triumph with it, and
your triumph is ours. Let us unite to preserve it for ever,
and may its base opponents turn pale with fear at the sight of
our sacred league."
</p>

<p>
Paoli had no foreboding of the position into which the course
of events was yet to bring him, in relation to this same France,
or that he was once more to stand opposed to her as a foe.
He left for Corsica. In Marseilles he was again received by a
Corsican deputation, with the members of which came the two
young club-leaders of Ajaccio&mdash;Joseph and Napoleon Bonaparte.
Paoli wept as he landed on Cape Corso and kissed the
soil of his native country; he was conducted in triumph from
canton to canton; and the Te Deum was sung throughout the
island.
</p>

<p>
Paoli, as President of the Assembly, and Lieutenant-general
of the Corsican National Guard, now devoted himself entirely
to the affairs of his country; in the year 1791 he also undertook
the command of the Division, and of the island. Although
the French Revolution had silenced the special interests of
the Corsicans, they began again to demand attention, and this
was particularly felt by Paoli, among whose virtues patriotism
was always uppermost. Paoli could never transform himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301'>[301]</a></span>
into a Frenchman, or forget that his people had possessed independence,
and its own constitution. A coolness sprang up
between him and certain parties in the island; the aristocratic
French party, namely, on the one hand, composed of such men
as Gaffori, Rossi, Peretti, and Buttafuoco; and the extreme
democrats on the other, who saw the welfare of the world
nowhere but in the whirl of the French Revolution, such as
the Bonapartes, Saliceti, and Arenas.
</p>

<p>
The execution of the king, and the wild and extravagant
procedure of the popular leaders in Paris, shocked the philanthropic
Paoli. He gradually broke with France, and the
rupture became manifest after the unsuccessful French expedition
from Corsica against Sardinia, the failure of which was
attributed to Paoli. His opponents had lodged a formal accusation
against him and Pozzo di Borgo, the Procurator-general,
libelling them as Particularists, who wished to
separate the island from France.
</p>

<p>
The Convention summoned him to appear before its bar
and answer the accusations, and sent Saliceti, Lacombe, and
Delcher, as commissaries to the island. Paoli, however, refused
to obey the decree, and sent a dignified and firm address
to the Convention, in which he repelled the imputations made
upon him, and complained of their forcing a judicial investigation
upon an aged man, and a martyr for freedom. Was a
Paoli to stand in a court composed of windy declaimers and
play-actors, and then lay his head, grown gray in heroism,
beneath the knife of the guillotine? Was this to be the end
of a life that had produced such noble fruits?
</p>

<p>
The result of this refusal to obey the orders of the Convention,
was the complete revolt of Paoli and the Paolists from
France. The patriots prepared for a struggle, and published
such enactments as plainly intimated that they wished Corsica
to be considered as separated from France. The commissaries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302'>[302]</a></span>
hastened home to Paris; and after receiving their report, the
Convention declared Paoli guilty of high treason, and placed
him beyond the protection of the law. The island was split
into two hostile camps, the patriots and the republicans, and
already fighting had commenced.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Paoli had formed the plan of placing the island
under the protection of the English Government. No course
lay nearer or was more natural than this. He had already
entered into communication with Admiral Hood, who commanded
the English fleet before Toulon, and now with his
ships appeared on the Corsican coast. He landed near Fiorenzo
on the 2d of February. This fortress fell after a severe
bombardment; and the commandant of Bastia, General Antonio
Gentili, capitulated. Calvi alone, which had withstood
in previous centuries so many assaults, still held out, though
the English bombs made frightful havoc in the little town,
and all but reduced it to a heap of ruins. At length, on the
20th of July 1794, the fortress surrendered; the commandant,
Casabianca, capitulated, and embarked with his troops for
France. As Bonifazio and Ajaccio were already in the hands
of the Paolists, the Republicans could no longer maintain a
footing on the island. They emigrated, and Paoli and the
English remained undisputed masters of Corsica.
</p>

<p>
A general assembly now declared the island completely
severed from France, and placed it under the protection of
England. England, however, did not content herself with
a mere right of protection&mdash;she claimed the sovereignty of
Corsica; and this became the occasion of a rupture between
Paoli and Pozzo di Borgo, whom Sir Gilbert Elliot had won
for the English side. On the 10th of June 1794, the Corsicans
declared that they would unite their country to Great
Britain; that it was, however, to remain independent, and be
governed by a viceroy according to its own constitution.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303'>[303]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Paoli had counted on the English king's naming him viceroy;
but he was deceived, for Gilbert Elliot was sent to
Corsica in this capacity&mdash;a serious blunder, since Elliot was
totally unacquainted with the condition of the island, and
his appointment could not but deeply wound Paoli.
</p>

<p>
The gray-haired man immediately withdrew into private
life; and as Elliot saw that his relation to the English, already
unpleasant, must soon become dangerous, he wrote to
George III. that the removal of Pasquale was desirable. This
was accomplished. The King of England, in a friendly letter,
invited Paoli to come to London, and spend his remaining
days in honour at the court. Paoli was in his own house at
Morosaglia when he received the letter. Sadly he now proceeded
to San Fiorenzo, where he embarked, and left his
country for the third and last time, in October 1795. The
great man shared the same fate as most of the legislators and
popular leaders of antiquity; he died rewarded with ingratitude,
unhappy, and in exile. The two greatest men of Corsica,
Pasquale and Napoleon, foes to each other, were both to end
their days and be buried on British territory.
</p>

<p>
The English government of Corsica&mdash;from ignorance of the
country very badly conducted&mdash;lasted only a short time. As
soon as Napoleon found himself victorious in Italy, he despatched
Generals Gentili and Casalta with troops to the
island; and scarcely had they made their appearance, when
the Corsicans, imbittered by the banishment of Paoli and
their other grievances, rose against the English. In almost
inexplicable haste they relinquished the island, from whose
people they were separated by wide and ineradicable differences
in national character; and by November 1796, not a
single Englishman remained in Corsica. The island was
now again under the supremacy of France.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale Paoli lived to see Napoleon Emperor. Fate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
granted him at least the satisfaction of seeing a countryman
of his own the most prominent and the most powerful actor in
European history. After passing twelve years more of exile
in London, he died peacefully on the 5th of February 1807,
at the age of eighty-two, his mind to the last occupied with
thoughts of the people whom he had so warmly loved. He
was the patriarch and oldest legislator of European liberty.
In his last letter to his friend Padovani, the noble old man,
reviewing his life, says humbly:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I have lived long enough; and if it were granted me to
begin my life anew, I should reject the gift, unless it were
accompanied with the intelligent cognisance of my past life,
that I might repair the errors and follies by which it has
been marked."
</p>

<p>
One of the Corsican exiles announced his death to his
countrymen in the following letter:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
GIACOMORSI TO SIGNOR PADOVANI.
</p>

<p class="rjust">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>July 2, 1807</i>.
</p>

<p>
"It is, alas! true that the newspapers were correctly informed
when they published the death of the poor General.
He fell ill on Monday the 2d of February, about half-past
eight in the evening, and at half-past eleven on the night of
Thursday he died in my arms. He leaves to the University
at Corte salaries of fifty pounds a year each, for four professors;
and another mastership for the School of Rostino, which is to
be founded in Morosaglia.
</p>

<p>
"On the 13th of February, he was buried in St. Pancras,
where almost all Catholics are interred. His funeral will
have cost nearly five hundred pounds. About the middle of
last April, I and Dr. Barnabi went to Westminster Abbey to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305'>[305]</a></span>
find a spot where we shall erect a monument to him with his
bust.
</p>

<p>
"Paoli said when dying:&mdash;My nephews have little to
hope for; but I shall bequeath to them, for their consolation,
and as something to remember me by, this saying from the
Bible&mdash;'I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not
seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.'"

PAOLI'S BIRTHPLACE.
</h3>

<p>
It was late when I reached Rostino, or Morosaglia. Under
this name is understood, not a single paese, but a number
of villages scattered among the rude, stern hills. I found my
way with difficulty through these little neighbour hamlets to
the convent of Morosaglia, climbing rough paths over rocks,
and again descending under gigantic chestnuts. A locanda
stands opposite the convent, a rare phenomenon in the country
districts of Corsica. I found there a lively and intelligent
young man, who informed me he was director of the Paoli
School, and promised me his assistance for the following day.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, I went to the little village of Stretta, where
the three Paolis were born. One must see this Casa Paoli in
order rightly to comprehend the history of the Corsicans,
and award a just admiration to these singular men. The
house is a very wretched, black, village-cabin, standing on a
granite rock; a brooklet runs immediately past the door;
it is a rude structure of stone, with narrow apertures in the
walls, such as are seen in towers; the windows few, unsymmetrically
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306'>[306]</a></span>
disposed, unglazed, with wooden shutters, as in
the time of Pasquale. When the Corsicans had elected him
their general, and he was expected home from Naples, Clemens
had glass put in the windows of the sitting-room, in order
to make the parental abode somewhat more comfortable for
his brother. But Paoli had no sooner entered and remarked
the luxurious alteration, than he broke every pane with his
stick, saying that he did not mean to live in his father's house
like a Duke, but like a born Corsican. The windows still
remain without glass; the eye overlooks from them the magnificent
panorama of the mountains of Niolo, as far as the
towering Monte Rotondo.
</p>

<p>
A relative of Paoli's&mdash;a simple country girl of the Tommasi
family&mdash;took me into the house. Everything in it
wears the stamp of humble peasant life. You mount a steep
wooden stair to the mean rooms, in which Paoli's wooden
table and wooden seat still stand. With joy, I saw myself in
the little chamber in which Pasquale was born; my emotions
on this spot were more lively and more agreeable than in the
birth-chamber of Napoleon.
</p>

<p>
Once more that fine face, with its classic, grave, and dignified
features, rose before me, and along with it the forms of a
noble father and a heroic brother. In this little room Pasquale
came to the world in April of the year 1724. His
mother was Dionisia Valentina, an excellent woman from a
village near Ponte Nuovo&mdash;the spot so fatal to her son. His
father, Hyacinth, we know already. He had been a physician,
and became general of the Corsicans along with Ceccaldi
and Giafferi. He was distinguished by exalted virtues,
and was worthy of the renown that attaches to his name as
the father of two such sons. Hyacinth had great oratorical
powers, and some reputation as a poet. Amid the din of arms
those powerful spirits had still time and genial force enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307'>[307]</a></span>
to rise free above the actual circumstances of their condition,
and sing war-hymns, like Tyrtæus.
</p>

<p>
Here is a sonnet addressed by Hyacinth to the brave
Giafferi, after the battle of Borgo:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"To crown unconquer'd Cyrnus' hero-son,</p>
<p>
See death descend, and destiny bend low;</p>
<p>
Vanquish'd Ligurians, by their sighs of wo,</p>
<p>
Swelling fame's trumpet with a louder tone.</p>
<p>
Scarce was the passage of the Golo won,</p>
<p>
Than in their fort of strength he storm'd the foe.</p>
<p>
Perils, superior numbers scorning so,</p>
<p>
Vict'ry still follow'd where his arms had shone.</p>
<p class="i5">
        Chosen by Cyrnus, fate the choice approved,</p>
<p class="i4">
      Trusting the mighty conflict to his sword,</p>
<p class="i4">
      Which Europe rose to watch, and watching stands.</p>
<p class="i4">
      By that sword's flash, e'en fate itself is moved;</p>
<p class="i4">
      Thankless Liguria has its stroke deplored,</p>
<p class="i4">
      While Cyrnus takes her sceptre from his hands."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Such men are as if moulded of Greek bronze. They are
the men of Plutarch, and resemble Aristides, Epaminondas,
and Timoleon. They could resign themselves to privation,
and sacrifice their interests and their lives; they were simple,
sincere, stout-hearted citizens of their country. They had become
great by facts, not by theories, and the high nobility of
their principles had a basis, positive and real, in their actions
and experiences. If we are to express the entire nature of
these men in one word, that word is Virtue, and they were
worthy of virtue's fairest reward&mdash;Freedom.
</p>

<p>
My glance falls upon the portrait of Pasquale. I could
not wish to imagine him otherwise. His head is large
and regular; his brow arched and high, the hair long and
flowing; his eyebrows bushy, falling a little down into the
eyes, as if swift to contract and frown; but the blue eyes are
luminous, large, and free&mdash;full of clear, perceptive intellect;
and an air of gentleness, dignity, and benevolence, pervades
the beardless, open countenance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308'>[308]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One of my greatest pleasures is to look at portraits and
busts of great men. Four periods of these attract and reward
our examination most&mdash;the heads of Greece; the Roman
heads; the heads of the great fifteenth and sixteenth centuries;
and the heads of the eighteenth century. It would
be an almost endless labour to arrange by themselves the
busts of the great men of the eighteenth century; but such
a Museum would richly reward the trouble. When I see a
certain group of these together, it seems to me as if I recognised
a family resemblance prevailing in it&mdash;a resemblance
arising from the presence in each, of one and the same spiritual
principle&mdash;Pasquale, Washington, Franklin, Vico, Genovesi,
Filangieri, Herder, Pestalozzi, Lessing.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale's head is strikingly like that of Alfieri. Although
the latter, like Byron, aristocratic, proud, and unbendingly
egotistic, widely differs in many respects from his contemporary,
Pasquale&mdash;the peaceful, philanthrophic citizen; he had
nevertheless a soul full of a marvellous energy, and burning
with the hatred of tyranny. He could understand such a
nature as Paoli's better than Frederick the Great. Frederick
once sent to this house a present for Paoli&mdash;a sword bearing
the inscription, <span lang='it_IT'><i>Libertas</i></span>, <span lang='it_IT'><i>Patria</i></span>. Away in distant Prussia,
the great king took Pasquale for an unusually able soldier.
He was no soldier; his brother Clemens was his sword; he
was the thinking head&mdash;a citizen and a strong and high-hearted
man. Alfieri comprehended him better, he dedicated
his <i>Timoleon</i> to him, and sent him the poem with this letter:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
TO SIGNOR PASQUALE PAOLI, THE NOBLE DEFENDER
OF CORSICA.
</p>

<p>
"To write tragedies on the subject of liberty, in the language
of a country which does not possess liberty, will perhaps,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309'>[309]</a></span>
with justice, appear mere folly to those who look no
further than the present. But he who draws conclusions for
the future from the constant vicissitudes of the past, cannot
pronounce such a rash judgment. I therefore dedicate this
my tragedy to you, as one of the enlightened few&mdash;one who,
because he can form the most correct idea of other times,
other nations, and high principles&mdash;is also worthy to have
been born and to have been active in a less effeminate century
than ours. Although it has not been permitted you
to give your country its freedom, I do not, as the mob
is wont to do, judge of men according to their success, but
according to their actions, and hold you entirely worthy to
listen to the sentiments of <i>Timoleon</i>, as sentiments which you
are thoroughly able to understand, and with which you can
sympathize.
</p>

<p class="rjust">
<span class="smcap">Vittoria Alfieri.</span>"
</p>
</div>

<p>
Alfieri inscribed on the copy of his tragedy which he sent
to Pasquale, the following verses:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"To Paoli, the noble Corsican</p>
<p>
Who made himself the teacher and the friend</p>
<p>
Of the young France.</p>
<p>
Thou with the sword hast tried, I with the pen,</p>
<p>
In vain to rouse our Italy from slumber.</p>
<p>
Now read; perchance my hand interprets rightly</p>
<p>
The meaning of thy heart."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
Alfieri exhibited much delicacy of perception in dedicating
the <i>Timoleon</i> to Paoli&mdash;the tragedy of a republican, who had
once, in the neighbouring Sicily, given wise democratic laws
to a liberated people, and then died as a private citizen.
Plutarch was a favourite author with Paoli, as with most of
the great men of the eighteenth century, and Epaminondas
was his favourite hero; the two were kindred natures&mdash;both
despised pomp and expensive living, and did not imagine that
their patriotic services and endeavours were incompatible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310'>[310]</a></span>
with the outward style of citizens and commoners. Pasquale
was fond of reading: he had a choice library, and his memory
was retentive. An old man told me that once, when as
a boy he was walking along the road with a school-fellow,
and reciting a passage from Virgil, Paoli accidentally came
up behind him, slapped him on the shoulder, and proceeded
himself with the passage.
</p>

<p>
Many particulars of Paoli's habits are still remembered by
the people here. The old men have seen him walking about
under these chestnuts, in a long green, gold-laced coat,<a name='FA_N' id='FA_N' href='#FN_N' class='fnanchor'>[N]</a>
and a vest of brown Corsican cloth. When he showed himself,
he was always surrounded by his peasantry, whom he
treated as equals. He was accessible to all, and he maintained
a lively recollection of an occasion when he had
deeply to repent his having shut himself up for an hour.
It was one day during the last struggle for independence;
he was in Sollacaro, embarrassed with an accumulation of
business, and had ordered the sentry to allow no one admission.
After some time a woman appeared, accompanied by
an armed youth. The woman was in mourning, wrapped in
the faldetta, and wore round her neck a black ribbon, to
which a Moor's head, in silver&mdash;the Corsican arms&mdash;was
attached. She attempted to enter&mdash;the sentry repelled her.
Paoli, hearing a noise, opened the door, and demanded hastily
and imperiously what she wanted. The woman said with
mournful calmness: "Signor, be so good as listen to me. I
was the mother of two sons; the one fell at the Tower of
Girolata; the other stands here. I come to give him to his
country, that he may supply the place of his dead brother."
She turned to the youth, and said to him: "My son, do not
forget that you are more your country's child than mine."
The woman went away. Paoli stood a moment as if thunderstruck;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311'>[311]</a></span>
then he sprang after her, embraced with emotion
mother and son, and introduced them to his officers. Paoli
said afterwards that he never felt so embarrassed as before
that noble-hearted woman.
</p>

<p>
He never married; his people were his family. His only
niece, the daughter of his brother Clemens, was married to a
Corsican called Barbaggi. But Paoli himself, capable of all
the virtues of friendship, was not without a noble female
friend, a woman of talent and glowing patriotism, to whom
the greatest men of the country confided their political ideas
and plans. This Corsican Roland, however, kept no <span lang='fr_FR'><i>salon</i></span>;
she was a nun, of the noble house of Rivarola. A single circumstance
evinces the ardent sympathy of this nun for the
patriotic struggles of her countrymen; after Achille Murati's
bold conquest of Capraja, she herself, in her exultation at
the success of the enterprise, went over to the island, as if to
take possession of it in the name of Paoli. Many of Pasquale's
letters are addressed to the Signora Monaca, and are altogether
occupied with politics, as if they had been written to a
man.
</p>

<p>
The incredible activity of Paoli appears from his collected
letters. The talented Italian Tommaseo (at present living
in exile in Corfu) has published a large volume containing
the most important of these. They are highly interesting,
and exhibit a manly, vigorous, and clear intellect. Paoli
disliked writing&mdash;he dictated, like Napoleon; he could not sit
long, his continually active mind allowed him no rest. It is
said of him that he never knew the date; that he could read
the future, and that he frequently had visions.
</p>

<p>
Paoli's memory is very sacred with his people. Napoleon
elates the soul of the Corsican with pride, because he was his
brother; but when you name the name of Paoli, his eye
brightens like that of a son, at the mention of a noble departed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312'>[312]</a></span>
father. It is impossible for a man to be more loved
and honoured by a whole nation after his death than Pasquale
Paoli; and if posthumous fame is a second life, then Corsica's
and Italy's greatest man of the eighteenth century lives a thousandfold&mdash;yes,
lives in every Corsican heart, from the tottering
graybeard who knew him in his youth, to the child on whose
soul his high example is impressed. No greater name can be
given to a man than "Father of his country." Flattery has
often abused it and made it ridiculous; among the Corsicans
I saw that it could also be applied with truth and justice.
</p>

<p>
Paoli contrasts with Napoleon, as philanthropy with self-love.
No curses of the dead rise to execrate his name. At
the nod of Napoleon, millions of human beings were murdered
for the sake of fame and power. The blood that Paoli shed,
flowed for freedom, and his country gave it freely as that
mother-bird that wounds her breast to give her fainting brood
to drink.
</p>

<p>
No battle-field makes Paoli's name illustrious; but his
memory is here honoured by the foundation-school of Morosaglia,
and this fame seems to me more human and more
beautiful than the fame of Marengo or the Pyramids.
</p>

<p>
I visited this school, the bequest of the noble patriot. The
old convent supplies an edifice. It consists of two classes;
the lower containing one hundred and fifty scholars, the upper
about forty. But two teachers are insufficient for the large
number of pupils. The rector of the lower class was so friendly
as to hold a little examination in my presence. I here again
remarked the <span lang='fr_FR'><i>naïveté</i></span> of the Corsican character, as displayed
by the boys. There were upwards of a hundred, between the
ages of six and fourteen, separated into divisions, wild, brown
little fellows, tattered and torn, unwashed, all with their caps
on their heads. Some wore crosses of honour suspended on
red ribbons; and these looked comical enough on the breasts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313'>[313]</a></span>
of the little brown rascals&mdash;sitting, perhaps, with their heads
supported between their two fists, and staring, frank and
free, with their black eyes at all within range&mdash;proud, probably,
of being Paoli scholars. These honours are distributed
every Saturday, and worn by the pupil for a week; a
silly, and at the same time, hurtful French practice, which
tends to encourage bad passions, and to drive the Corsican&mdash;in
whom nature has already implanted an unusual thirst for
distinction&mdash;even in his boyhood, to a false ambition. These
young Spartans were reading Telemachus. On my requesting
the rector to allow them to translate the French into
Italian, that I might see how they were at home in their
mother-tongue, he excused himself with the express prohibition
of the Government, which "does not permit Italian in the
schools." The branches taught were writing, reading, arithmetic,
and the elements of geography and biblical history.
</p>

<p>
The schoolroom of the lower class is the chapter-hall of the
old convent in which Clemens Paoli dreamed away the closing
days of his life. Such a spacious, airy Aula as that in
which these Corsican youngsters pursue their studies, with
the view from its windows of the mighty hills of Niolo, and
the battle-fields of their sires, would be an improvement in
many a German university. The heroic grandeur of external
nature in Corsica seems to me to form, along with the recollections
of their past history, the great source of cultivation
for the Corsican people; and there is no little importance in
the glance which that Corsican boy is now fixing on the portrait
yonder on the wall&mdash;for it is the portrait of Pasquale
Paoli.

CLEMENS PAOLI.
</h3>

<div class="blockquot center">
<p>
"Blessed be the Lord my strength, who teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers
to fight."&mdash;Psalm cxliv.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The convent of Morosaglia is perhaps the most venerable
monument of Corsican history. The hoary structure as it
stands there, brown and gloomy, with the tall, frowning pile
of its campanile by its side, seems itself a tradition in stone.
It was formerly a Franciscan cloister. Here, frequently, the
Corsican parliaments were held. Here Pasquale had his
rooms, his bureaus, and often, during the summer, he was to
be seen among the monks&mdash;who, when the time came, did
not shrink from carrying the crucifix into the fight, at the
head of their countrymen. The same convent was also a
favourite residence of his brave brother Clemens, and he died
here, in one of the cells, in the year 1793.
</p>

<p>
Clemens Paoli is a highly remarkable character. He resembles
one of the Maccabees, or a crusader glowing with
religious fervour. He was the eldest son of Hyacinth. He
had served with distinction as a soldier in Naples; then he
was made one of the generals of the Corsicans. But state affairs
did not accord with his enthusiastic turn of mind. When
his brother was placed at the head of the Government he
withdrew into private life, assumed the garb of the Tertiaries,
and buried himself in religious contemplation. Like
Joshua, he lay entranced in prayer before the Lord, and
rose from prayer to rush into battle, for the Lord had given
his foes into his hand. He was the mightiest in fight, and
the humblest before God. His gloomy nature has something
in it prophetic, flaming, self-abasing, like that of Ali.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315'>[315]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Wherever the danger was greatest, he appeared like an
avenging angel. He rescued his brother at the convent of
Bozio, when he was besieged there by Marius Matra; he expelled
the Genoese from the district of Orezza, after a frightful
conflict. He took San Pellegrino and San Fiorenzo; in
innumerable fights he came off victorious. When the Genoese
assaulted the fortified camp at Furiani with their entire force,
Clemens remained for fifty-six days firm and unsubdued among
the ruins, though the whole village was a heap of ashes. A
thousand bombs fell around him, but he prayed to the God
of hosts, and did not flinch, and victory was on his side.
</p>

<p>
Corsica owed her freedom to Pasquale, as the man who
organized her resources; but to Clemens alone as the soldier
who won it with his sword. He signalized himself also subsequently
in the campaign of 1769, by the most splendid
deeds of arms. He gained the glorious victory of Borgo; he
fought desperately at Ponte Nuovo, and when all was lost,
he hastened to rescue his brother. He threw himself with a
handful of brave followers in the direction of Niolo, to intercept
General Narbonne, and protect his brother's flight. As
soon as he had succeeded in this, he hastened to Pasquale at
Bastelica, and sorrowfully embarked with him for Tuscany.
</p>

<p>
He did not go to England. He remained in Tuscany; for
the strange language of a foreign country would have deepened
his affliction. Among the monks in the beautiful,
solitary cloister of Vallombrosa, he sank again into fervent
prayer and severe penance; and no one who saw this monk
lying in prayer upon his knees, could have recognised in
him the hero of patriot struggles, and the soldier terrible in
fight.
</p>

<p>
After twenty years of cloister-life in Tuscany, Clemens returned
shortly before his brother to Corsica. Once more his
heart glowed with the hope of freedom for his country; but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316'>[316]</a></span>
events soon taught the grayhaired hero that Corsica was lost
for ever. In sorrow and penance he died in December of the
same year in which his brother was summoned before the
Convention, to answer the charge of high treason.
</p>

<p>
In Clemens, patriotism had become a cultus and a religion.
A great and holy passion, stirred to an intense glow, is in
itself religious; when it takes possession of a people, more
especially when it does so in periods of calamity and severe
pressure, it expresses itself as religious worship. The priests
in those days preached battle from every pulpit, the monks
marched with the ranks into the fight, and the crucifixes
served instead of standards. The parliaments were generally
held in convents, as if God himself were to preside over
them, and once, as we saw in their history, the Corsicans by
a decree of their Assembly placed the country under the protection
of the Holy Virgin.
</p>

<p>
Pasquale, too, was religious. I saw in his house the little
dark room which he had made into a chapel; it had been
allowed to remain unchanged. He there prayed daily to God.
But Clemens lay for six or seven hours each day in prayer. He
prayed even in the thick of battle&mdash;a figure terrible to look on,
with his beads in one hand and his musket in the other, clad
like the meanest Corsican, and not to be recognised save by his
great fiery eyes and bushy eyebrows. It is said of him that
he could load his piece with furious rapidity, and that, always
sure of his aim, he first prayed for mercy to the soul of the
man he was about to shoot, then crying: "Poor mother!"
he sacrificed his foe to the God of freedom. When the battle
was over, he was gentle and mild, but always grave and profoundly
melancholy. A frequent saying of his was: "My
blood and my life are my country's; my soul and my thoughts
are my God's."
</p>

<p>
Men of Pasquale's type are to be sought among the Greeks;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317'>[317]</a></span>
but the types of Clemens among the Maccabees. He was not
one of Plutarch's heroes; he was a hero of the Old Testament.

THE OLD HERMIT.
</h3>

<p>
I had heard in Stretta that a countryman of mine was
living there, a Prussian&mdash;a strange old man, lame, and obliged
to use crutches. The townspeople had also informed him of
my arrival. Just as I was leaving the chamber in which Clemens
Paoli had died, lost in meditation on the character of
this God-fearing old hero, my lame countryman came hopping
up to me, and shook hands with me in the honest and
hearty German style. I had breakfast set for us; we sat
down, and I listened for several hours to the curious stories
of old Augustine of Nordhausen.
</p>

<p>
"My father," he said, "was a Protestant clergyman, and
wished to educate me in the Lutheran faith; but from my
childhood I was dissatisfied with Protestantism, and saw well
that the Lutheran persuasion was a vile corruption of the only
true church&mdash;the church in spirit and in truth. I took it
into my head to become a missionary. I went to the Latin
School in Nordhausen, and remained there until I entered the
classes of logic and rhetoric. And after learning rhetoric, I
left my native country to go to the beautiful land of Italy, to
a Trappist convent at Casamari, where I held my peace for
eleven years."
</p>

<p>
"But, friend Augustine, how were you able to endure
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it needs a merry heart to bear it: a melancholy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318'>[318]</a></span>
man becomes mad among the Trappists. I understood the
carpenter-trade, and worked at it all day, beguiling my weariness
by singing songs to myself in my heart."
</p>

<p>
"What had you to eat in the convent?"
</p>

<p>
"Two platefuls of broth, as much bread as we liked, and
half a bottle of wine. I ate little, but I never left a drop of
wine in my flask. God be praised for the excellent wine!
The brother on my right was always hungry, and ate his two
platefuls of broth and five rolls to the bargain."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever seen Pope Pio Nono?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and spoken with him too, just like a friend. He
was then bishop in Rieti; and, one Good-Friday, I went
thither in my capote&mdash;I was in a different convent then&mdash;to
fetch the holy oil. I was at that time very ill. The Pope
kissed my capote, when I went to him in the evening to take
my leave. 'Fra Agostino,' said he, 'you are sick, you must
have something to eat.' 'My lord bishop,' said I, 'I never
saw a brother eat on Good-Friday.' 'No matter, I give you
a dispensation; I see you are sick.' And he sent to the best
inn in the town, and they brought me half a fowl, some soup,
wine, and confectionary; and the bishop made me sit down
to table with him."
</p>

<p>
"What! did the holy Father eat on Good-Friday?"
</p>

<p>
"Only three nuts and three figs. After this I grew worse,
and removed to Toscana. But one day I ceased to find pleasure
in the ways of men; their deeds were hateful to me. I
resolved to become a hermit. So I took my tools, purchased
a few necessaries, and sailed to the little island of Monte
Cristo. The island is nine miles<a name='FA_O' id='FA_O' href='#FN_O' class='fnanchor'>[O]</a> round; not a living thing
dwells on it but wild goats, serpents, and rats. In ancient
times the Emperor Diocletian banished Saint Mamilian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319'>[319]</a></span>
there&mdash;the Archbishop of Palermo. The good saint built
a church upon the island; a convent also was afterwards
erected. Fifty monks once lived there&mdash;first Benedictines,
then Cistercians, and afterwards Carthusians of the Order of
St. Bruno. The monks of Monte Cristo built many hospitals,
and did much good in Toscana; the hospital of Maria
Novella in Florence, too, was founded by them. Then, you
see, came the Saracens, and carried off the monks of Monte
Cristo with their oxen and their servants; the goats they could
not catch&mdash;they escaped to the mountains, and have ever
since lived wild among rocks."
</p>

<p>
"Did you stay in the old convent?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it is in ruins. I lived in a cave, which I fitted up
with the help of my tools. I built a wall, too, before the
mouth of it."
</p>

<p>
"How did you spend the long days? You prayed a great
deal, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no! I am no Pharisee. One can't pray much. Whatever
God wills must happen. I had my flute; and I amused
myself with shooting the wild goats; or explored the island
for stones and plants; or watched the sea as it rose and fell
upon the rocks. I had books to read, too."
</p>

<p>
"Such as?"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The works of the Jesuit Paul Pater Segneri."
</p>

<p>
"What grows upon the island?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but heath and bilberries. There are one or two
pretty little green valleys, and all the rest is gray rock. A
Sardinian once visited the island, and gave me some seeds;
so I grew a few vegetables and planted some trees."
</p>

<p>
"Are there any fine kinds of stone to be found there?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is beautiful granite, and black tourmaline,
which is found in a white stone; and I also discovered three
different kinds of garnets. At last I fell sick in Monte Cristo&mdash;sick
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320'>[320]</a></span>
to death, when there happily arrived a number of
Tuscans, who carried me to the mainland. I have now
been eleven years in this cursed island, living among scoundrels&mdash;thorough
scoundrels. The doctors sent me here; but
I hope to see Italy again before a year is over. There is no
country in the world like Italy to live in, and they are a
fine people the Italians. I am growing old, I have to go upon
crutches; and I one day said to myself, 'What am I to do?
I must soon give up my joiner's work, but I cannot beg;' so
I went and roamed about the mountains, and by good fortune
discovered Negroponte."
</p>

<p>
"Negroponte? what is that?"
</p>

<p>
"The clay with which they make pipes in the island of
Negroponte; we call it <span lang='de_DE'><i>meerschaum</i></span> at home, you know. Ah,
it is a beautiful earth&mdash;the very flower of minerals. The Negroponte
here is as good as that in Turkey, and when I have
my pipes finished, I shall be able to say that I am the first
Christian that has ever worked in it."
</p>

<p>
Old Augustine would not let me off till I had paid a visit
to his laboratory. He had established himself in one of the
rooms formerly occupied by poor Clemens Paoli, and pointed
out to me with pride his Negroponte and the pipes he had
been engaged in making, and which he had laid in the sun
to dry.
</p>

<p>
I believe that, once in his life, there comes to every man a
time when he would fain leave the society of men, and go into
the green woods and be a hermit, and an hour when his soul
would gladly find rest even in the religious silence of the
Trappist.
</p>

<p>
I have here told my reader the brief story of old Augustine's
life, because it attracted me so strongly at the time,
and seemed to me a true specimen of German character.

And thrills the youthful pilgrim on his way</p>
<p>
With thoughts of love, if from afar he hears</p>
<p>
The vesper bell, that mourns the dying day."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
A single cypress stands yonder on the hill, kindled by the
red glow of evening, like an altar taper. It is a tree that
suits the hour and the mood&mdash;an Ave Maria tree, monumental
as an obelisk, dark and mournful. Those avenues of
cypresses leading to the cloisters and burying-grounds in Italy
are very beautiful. We have the weeping-willow. Both are
genuine churchyard trees, yet each in a way of its own. The
willow with its drooping branches points downwards to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322'>[322]</a></span>
tomb, the cypress rises straight upwards, and points from the
grave to heaven. The one expresses inconsolable grief, the
other believing hope. The symbolism of trees is a significant
indication of the unity of man and nature, which he constantly
draws into the sphere of his emotions, to share in them, or
to interpret them. The fir, the laurel, the oak, the olive, the
palm, have all their higher meaning, and are poetical language.
</p>

<p>
I saw few cypresses in Corsica, and these of no great size;
and yet such a tree would be in its place in this Island of
Death. But the tree of peace grows here on every hand; the
war-goddess Minerva, to whom the olive is sacred, is also the
goddess of peace.
</p>

<p>
I had fifteen miles to walk from Morosaglia, all the way
through wild, silent hills, the towering summits of Niolo constantly
in view, the snow-capped Cinto, Artiga, and Monte
Rotondo, the last named nine thousand feet in height, and the
highest hill in Corsica. It stood bathed in a glowing violet,
and its snow-fields gleamed rosy red. I had already been on
its summit, and recognised distinctly, to my great delight, the
extreme pinnacle of rock on which I had stood with a goatherd.
When the moon rose above the mountains, the picture
was touched with a beauty as of enchantment.
</p>

<p>
Onwards through the moonlight and the breathless silence
of the mountain wilds; not a sound to be heard, except sometimes
the tinkling of a brook; the rocks glittering where they
catch the moonlight like wrought silver; nowhere a village, nor
a human soul. I went at hap-hazard in the direction where
I saw far below in the valley the mists rising from the Golo.
Yet it appeared to me that I had taken a wrong road, and I
was on the point of crossing through a ravine to the other
side, when I met some muleteers, who told me that I had taken
not only the right but very shortest road to my destination.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323'>[323]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At length I reached the Golo. The river flows through a
wide valley; the air is full of fever, and is shunned. It is the
atmosphere of a battle-field&mdash;of the battle-field of Ponte Nuovo.
I was warned in Morosaglia against passing through the night-mists
of the Golo, or staying long in Ponte alla Leccia. Those
who wander much there are apt to hear the ghosts beating the
death-drum, or calling their names; they are sure at least to
catch fever, and see visions. I believe I had a slight touch
of the last affection, for I saw the whole battle of the Golo
before me, the frightful monk, Clemens Paoli in the thickest
of it, with his great fiery eyes and bushy eyebrows, his rosary
in the one hand, and his firelock in the other, crying mercy
on the soul of him he was about to shoot. Wild flight&mdash;wounded&mdash;dying!
</p>

<p>
"The Corsicans," says Peter Cyrnæus, "are men who are
ready to die." The following is a characteristic trait:&mdash;A
Frenchman came upon a Corsican who had received his death-wound,
and lay waiting for death without complaint. "What
do you do," he asked, "when you are wounded, without physicians,
without hospitals?" "We die!" said the Corsican, with
the laconism of a Spartan. A people of such manly breadth
and force of character as the Corsicans, is really scarcely honoured
by comparison with the ancient heroic nations. Yet
Lacedæmon is constantly present to me here. If it is allowable
to say that the spirit of the Hellenes lives again in the
wonderfully-gifted people of Italy, this is mainly true, in my
opinion, as applied to the two countries&mdash;and they are neighbours
of each other&mdash;of Tuscany and Corsica. The former
exhibits all the ideal opulence of the Ionic genius; and while
her poets, from Dante and Petrarch to the time of Ariosto,
sang in her melodious language, and her artists, in painting,
sculpture, and architecture, renewed the days of Pericles;
while her great historians rivalled the fame of Thucydides,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324'>[324]</a></span>
and the philosophers of her Academy filled the world with
Platonic ideas, here in Corsica the rugged Doric spirit again
revived, and battles of Spartan heroism were fought.
</p>

<p>
The young Napoleon visited the battle-field of the Golo in
the year 1790. He was then twenty-one years old; but he
had probably seen it before when a boy. There is something
fearfully suggestive in this: Napoleon on the first battle-field
that his eyes ever lighted on&mdash;a stripling, without career, and
without stain of guilt, he who was yet to crimson a hemisphere&mdash;from
the ocean to the Volga, and from the Alps to
the wastes of Lybia&mdash;with the blood of his battle-fields.
</p>

<p>
It was a night such as this when the young Napoleon
roamed here on the field of Golo. He sat down by the river,
which on that day of battle, as the people tell, rolled down
corpses, and ran red for four-and-twenty miles to the sea.
The feverous mist made his head heavy, and filled it with
dreams. A spirit stood behind him&mdash;a red sword in its hand.
The spirit touched him, and sped away, and the soul of the
young Napoleon followed the spirit through the air. They
hovered over a field&mdash;a bloody battle was being fought there&mdash;a
young general is seen galloping over the corpses of the
slain. "Montenotte!" cried the demon; "and it is thou
that fightest this battle!" They flew on. They hover over
a field&mdash;a bloody battle is fighting there&mdash;a young general
rushes through clouds of smoke, a flag in his hand, over a
bridge. "Lodi!" cried the demon; "and it is thou that fightest
this battle!" On and on, from battle-field to battle-field.
They halt above a stream; ships are burning on it; its waves
roll blood and corpses. "The Pyramids!" cries the demon;
"this battle too thou shalt fight!" And so they continue
their flight from one battle-field to another; and, one after
the other, the spirit utters the dread names&mdash;"Marengo! Austerlitz!
Eylau! Friedland! Wagram! Smolensk! Borodino!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325'>[325]</a></span>
Beresina! Leipzig!" till he is hovering over the last battle-field,
and cries, with a voice of thunder, "Waterloo! Emperor,
thy last battle!&mdash;and here thou shalt fall!"
</p>

<p>
The young Napoleon sprang to his feet, there on the banks
of the Golo, and he shuddered; he had dreamt a mad and a
fearful dream.
</p>

<p>
Now that whole bloody phantasmagoria was a consequence
of the same vile exhalations of the Golo that were beginning
to take effect on myself. In this wan moonlight, and on
this steaming Corsican battle-field, if anywhere, it must be
pardonable to have visions. Above yon black, primeval,
granite hills hangs the red moon&mdash;no! it is the moon no
longer, it is a great, pale, bloody, horrid head that hovers
over the island of Corsica, and dumbly gazes down on it&mdash;a
Medusa-head, a Vendetta-head, snaky-haired, horrible. He
who dares to look on this head becomes&mdash;not stone, but an
Orestes seized by madness and the Furies, so that he shall
murder in headlong passion, and then wander from mountain
to mountain, and from cavern to cavern, behind him the avengers
of blood and the sleuthhounds of the law that give him
no moment's peace.
</p>

<p>
What fantasies! and they will not leave me! But, Heaven
be praised! there is the post-house of Ponte alla Leccia, and
I hear the dogs bark. In the large desolate room sit some
men at a table round a steaming oil-lamp; they hang their
heads on their breasts, and are heavy with sleep. A priest,
in a long black coat, and black hat, is walking to and fro; I
will begin a conversation with the holy man, that he may drive
the vile rout of ghosts and demons out of my head.
</p>

<p>
But although this priest was a man of unshaken orthodoxy,
he could not exorcise the wicked Golo-spirit, and I arrived in
Bastia with the most violent of headaches. I complained to
my hostess of what the sun and the fog had done to me, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326'>[326]</a></span>
began to believe I should die unlamented on a foreign shore.
The hostess said there was no help unless a wise woman came
and made the <span lang='it_IT'><i>orazion</i></span> over me. However, I declined the
<span lang='it_IT'><i>orazion</i></span>, and expressed a wish to sleep. I slept the deepest
sleep for one whole day and a night. When I awoke, the
blessed sun stood high and glorious in the heavens.

<h2>
CONSTABLE'S MISCELLANY OF FOREIGN LITERATURE.
</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>
For our supply of the comforts and luxuries of life, we lay the world
under contribution: fresh from every quarter of the globe we draw a portion
of its yearly produce. The field of literature is well-nigh as broad as
that of commerce; as rich and varied in its annual fruits; and, if gleaned
carefully, might furnish to our higher tastes as large an annual ministry of
enjoyment. Believing that a sufficient demand exists to warrant the enterprise,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Constable &amp; Co.</span> propose to present to the British public a
Series of the most popular accessions which the literature of the globe is
constantly receiving. Europe alone,&mdash;its more northern and eastern lands
especially,&mdash;offers to the hand of the selector most inviting and abundant
fruits; Asia may supply a few rarer exotics; whilst in America the fields
are whitening to a harvest into which many a hasty sickle has been already
thrust, and from which many a rich sheaf may be hereafter gathered.
</p>

<p>
Fully aware of the extent and difficulty of such an effort, the Publishers
will spare no pains to make the execution of their undertaking commensurate
with its high aim. They have already opened channels of communication
with various countries, and secured the aid of those who are minutely
acquainted with their current literature; and they take this opportunity of
stating, that even where no legal copyright in this country can be claimed
by the author or publisher of a work of which they may avail themselves,
an equitable share of any profit which may arise from its sale will be set
aside for his advantage.
</p>

<p>
The Series will be made as varied as possible, that there may be something
in it to suit the tastes of all who seek instruction or healthful recreation
for the mind,&mdash;and its range will therefore be as extensive as the field
of Literature itself: while, at the same time, it shall be the endeavour of
its editors to select, for the most part, works of general or universal interest.
</p>

<p>
The Publishers are unable to state the exact periods at which their
<span class="smcap">Miscellany of Foreign Literature</span> will appear, but they believe that the
number of volumes issued during the first year will not exceed <i>six</i>; so that
taking the average price per volume as <i>Three Shillings and Sixpence</i>, the
cost to Subscribers would not exceed <i>One Guinea</i>; while, by the addition
of a <i>special</i> title-page for each work issued, those persons who may wish to
select an occasional publication will be saved the awkwardness of placing
in their library a volume or volumes evidently detached from a continuous
Series.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
